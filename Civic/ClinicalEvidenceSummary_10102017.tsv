This mutation was not found in the pre-crizotinib biopsy. EML4-ALK T1151insT was expressed In Ba/F3 cells and an IC50 of 431.8 nM was obtained, which was 16 times higher than for EML4-ALK wild-type, indicating strong crizotinib resistance. EML4-ALK containing H3122 NSCLC cells were incubated in increasing levels of crizotinib inducing resistance. The resulting cell line H3122 CR2 had IC50 10x greater to crizotinib than parental H3122, and was found to contain 1151 insT mutation. In western blots, pALK levels in H3122 CR2 cells remained apparent under 1000 nM crizotinib, whereas pALK signal was ablated under these conditions in parental H3122 cells.

SCID mice xenografted with H2228 were treated for 14 days with crizotinib (100 mg/kg) or ceritinib (25 or 50 mg/kg). All treatments caused tumor regression, but tumors recurred within 11 days after crizotinib treatment withdrawal. 4/8 mice treated with 25 mg/kg ceritinib showed regrowth after 1 month treatment withdrawal. The remaining 4/8 mice treated at 25 mg/kg ceritinib, and all mice treated at 50 mg/kg ceritinib maintained complete remission for four months. While 100 mg/kg crizotinib in mice approximates levels 3-5 times the maximal tolerated dose in humans, the authors state 25 to 50 mg/kg ceritinib in mice is predicted to approximate tolerable doses in humans.

The cell lines NCI-H3122 (containing EML4-ALK variant 1) and NCI-H2228 (containing the EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20 fusion-variant 3a/3b) were identified. TAE684 (0.1uM) appreciably inhibited growth as well as Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in variant 1 containing H3122 cells. However, incomplete inhibition in 3a/3b containing H2228 cells was observed.

ALK	238	EML4-ALK E6;A20	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	2,4-pyrimidinediamine	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In a cohort of 75 NSCLC patients that had tested positive for 3 EML4-ALK rearrangements, two individuals were identified via RT-PCR with a novel EML4-ALK translocation involving the first 6 exons of EML4 fused to the kinase domain of ALK. Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20.  3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice.  The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.  The results indicate that 3a/b is a targetable driver-mutation as other EML4-ALK variants.

This corresponded to 0% event free survival (EFS) in these mice by 6 weeks with crizotinib treatment, but 100% EFS with PF-06463922 treatment. Comparison of crizotinib and PF-06463922 growth inhibition in F1174L cells SH-SY5Y, NBSD 415-IMDM and KELLY showed increased sensitivity to PF-06463922, as compared to crizotinib. Inhibition effects were not seen on neuroblastoma cells with wild type ALK (NB-EBc1, SK-N-BE(2)C). Decreased phosphorylation on ALK tyrosine 1278 was seen with PF-06463922 over crizotinib at 10 and 100 nM concentrations in SH-SY5Y cells. PF-06463922 was well tolerated in the in-vivo models.

Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment.  Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response.  Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition.  31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen.  9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.  On the basis of this and a Phase II study, accelerated approval for crizotinib in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC was granted.

Patient one, 26 yrs old, had been treated with the CHOP-15 chemotherapy regimen, then salvage chemotherapy to prepare for autologous bone marrow transplant but ultimately relapsed. After initiation of crizotinib, PET, CT and bone marrow aspirates showed complete remission of previous lesions at 28 days. At time of publication the patient continued to show persistent response at 6 months. A 20 year old patient relapsed after one month of CHOP, and was treated with further chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation resulting in partial response of 1 month. Crizotinib was initialized, and after 12 days PET scan showed complete regression of all lesions. On day 60 bone marrow aspirates were ALK-negative (pretreatment evaluation showed 8% ALK-positive).

ALK	238	ALK FUSIONS	Colorectal Adenocarcinoma	0050861	Crizotinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	26 colorectal adenocarcinoma samples were run on Affymetrix human Exon 1.0 arrays and a computational method that assessed differential 5 and 3 gene expression for each gene was used to find potential rearrangements.  One sample showed potential rearrangement and RT-PCR demonstrated an EML4-ALK fusion where EML4 exon 21 was fused to ALK exon 13. This EML4-ALK variant is different from those commonly found in NSCLC. Genomic PCR verified the existence of the fusion breakpoint in intronic space, indicating that some colorectal adenocarcinoma may have targetable ALK-fusion driver mutations.

ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib \u2013 a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.   \n\nALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

ALK	238	ALK FUSION G1269A	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Ceritinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	The NSCLC cell line MGH021-4, harboring SQSTM1-ALK G1269A, was 6 times more sensitive to ceritinib (80nM GI50) than crizotinib (500 nM) in proliferation assays and caused notable reductions in phospho-ALK and phospho-AKT (detected by Western blot) at concentrations 10 fold lower than crizotinib. GI50 values were similar in Ba/F3 cells expressing either EML4-ALK wild-type or EML4-ALK G1269A (1.6nM and 2.2nM, respectively). In contrast, crizotinib treatment of Ba/F3 with EML4-ALK G1269A had survival GI50 of 130nM.

IC50 of 33 nM was seen, which was 1.5 times the IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type, indicating sensitivity of the G1269A mutation to ceritinib in the context of EML4-ALK. The mutation was also tested for ceritinib sensitivity in the context of NPM-ALK, where IC50 values were reported of 19 nM and 20 nM for mutant and wild-type versions, respectively, also indicating sensitivity. In western blots,  Y1604 pALK levels for wild-type NPM-ALK were ablated at 100 nM, while at 100 nM residual pALK levels were seen in G1269A blotting, with ablation of signal at and above 300 nM, which differed somewhat from the equivalent IC50 values reported for mutant and wild-type in the NPM-ALK background, but still agrees with sensitivity to ceritinib for this mutation.

In Ba/F3 cells with ectopic EML4-ALK variant 1 G1269A, IC50 of 84 nM was reported with alectinib, which was a 6 fold increase over IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type. The authors considered a fold difference of 4 to 10 between the alectinib-sensitized wild-type and mutant variant to indicate a resistant mutant variant. In the background of the NPM-ALK fusion, IC50 for G1269A mutation was 104 nM, which was 5.3 fold that reported for NPM-ALK wild-type. Western blots of alectinib treated NPM-ALK G1269A were performed and reduced pALK Y1604 was seen at 300 nM alectinib, and no pALK at 1000 nM.

ALK	238	CLTC-ALK	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma	0050745	Crizotinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	A 21 year old male presented with lymphadenopathy and a low density mass in pancreas. Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation. The authors conclude that partial response to crizotinib was observed and that in future trials ALK rearranged DLBCL patients might see increased benefit with earlier application of targeted therapy during the treatment course.

ALK	238	CLTC-ALK	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma	0050745		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	CLTC-ALK is one of the most common ALK fusions found in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In a retrospective study of 38 patients with ALK-rearranged DLBCL, 3 were CD20 positive. Only one showed cytoplasmic, nuclear and nucleolar staining associated with NPM-ALK, while the others showed granular cytoplasmic ALK stain characteristic for CLTC-ALK.  Seven molecularly characterized cases were positive for CLTC-ALK.  6/7 patients were treated with CHOP chemotherapy with survival of 5, 10, 26 and 27 months, and two alive at end of study, and one CD20 positive patient was treated with CHOP chemotherapy supplemented with CD20-targeted rituximab, with survival of 8 months, resulting in median survival of 26 months for this group.  Although these numbers are not sufficient for statistical comparison, they compare unfavorably to 3.1 year overall survival and 45% 5 year survival of CHOP treated DLBCL patients, and even less favorably to R-CHOP standard of care for CD20 positive DLBCL, suggesting poor prognosis for CLTC-ALK DLBCL and need for updated treatment in this cohort.

ALK	238	CLTC-ALK	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma	0050745	TAE684	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	A cell line called LM1 was established from the bone marrow of a 13 year old female patient with relapsed CLTC-ALK positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient had been heavily treated with chemotherapy before establishment of the cell line. The cell line maintained the tumor immunophenotype.  SNP analysis of patient bone marrow mononuclear cells and LM1 showed chromosomal changes associated with the cell line but 94.7% of SNPs were identically called.  ALK kinase inhibitor TAE684 induced cell death in LM1 cells at low nanomolar concentrations, while it did not significantly effect the ALK-rearrangement negative DLBCL cell line Karpas422.  LM1 cells formed tumors in 3/10 SCID and 9/10 NOD-SCID mice.  CD30 and CD138 immmunostaining were maintained between original tumor and LM1 xenografts. In mice, LM1 but not Karpas422 xenografts regressed with TAE684 administration, and complete remission for 13 weeks was observed before experiment was terminated.

ALK	238	EML4-ALK	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	17-DMAG,Crizotinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 1 causes IL3 independent growth. Incubation of EML4-ALK variant 1 transduced Ba/F3 cells with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG caused cell death that was reversible with IL3 addition, suggesting that 17-DMAG was effecting the EML4-ALK driver of IL3-independant proliferation, and that EML4-ALK variant 1 is a client protein of Hsp90. The degree of Hsp90 dependence, and targetability of EML4-ALK for Hsp90 inhibition, may vary among ALK fusion variants.  Addition of crizotinib to 17-DMAG caused synergistic death effects, suggesting potential clinical benefit for this inhibitor combination in targeting EML4-ALK variant 1.

ALK	238	EML4-ALK	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	WHI-P154	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci.  Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.

After further chemotherapy along with maintenance imatinib, crizotinib was started at 200mg twice daily, and a maximal partial response was achieved 5 months later, with regrowth occurring 2 months later. After further surgery, crizotinib was restarted at 250mg twice daily and almost 2 years later the patient was in complete radiographic remission. Another patient with non-ALK rearranged IMT was administered crizotinib in this study but did not respond.

This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.

ALK	238	EML4-ALK E20;A20	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Crizotinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.

In this study, targeted activity against NPM-ALK by the ALK and MET inhibitor crizotinib was assessed in cell lines and tumor xenograft models. Treatment of NPM-ALK positive ALCL cell lines Karpas299 and SU-DHL-1 potently inhibited growth, and this was seen to occur at concentrations which also inhibited NPM-ALK phosphorylation in these cells.

ALK	238	NPM-ALK	Cancer	162	Crizotinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Different ALK fusions were compared for crizotinib sensitivity using the Ba/F3 cell model. In Ba/F3 cells, AK fusions capable of acting as cancer drivers will cause IL3 independent growth, and ALK inhibition will reduce growth and cell viability. It was found that lower concentrations of crizotinib in the range of 0.3 micromolar, would inhibit Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK variant 2 and KIF5b-ALK, while concentrations around 1 micromolar would inhibit EML4-ALK variant 3a, with NPM-ALK cells being significantly inhibited around 0.7 micromolar crizotinib. 24 hour incubations with and without cyclohexamide (which inhibits protein synthesis) were performed in Ba/F3 cells ectopically expressing ALK fusions. The results indicated that NPM-ALK and EML4-ALK variant 3a protein levels were more stable in cells than other variants since there was more residual protein remaining in cells containing these variants after the cyclohexamide incubations, implying lower rate of protein turnover.

ALK	238	NPM-ALK	Cancer	162	Crizotinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In Ba/F3 cells, crizotinib sensitivty of the NPM-ALK variant was compared to crizotinib sensitivity of EML4-ALK variant 3. 50% of maximal inhibitory concentration for NPM-ALK was 42 nM, which was approximately 4x greater than IC50 of 11 nM obtained for EML4-ALK. The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells.

ALK	238	EML4-ALK  V1180L	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	TAE684	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	The V1180L mutation in the kinase domain of rearranged ALK was found in an alectinib resistant cell line named H3122 CHR-A1, which was derived from the alectinib sensitive EML4-ALK variant 1 containing NSCLC cell line H3122 by passaging into higher concentrations of alectinib. This cell line is a model for gain of alectinib resistance, and also shows resistance to crizotinib. On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3.

ALK	238	ALK FUSION F1245C	Cancer	162	Crizotinib	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	A Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK variant 1 was created, and then exposed to the DNA modifying agent ENU. Cells were subsequently cultured in 96 well plates at increasing concentrations of crizotinib (250, 500, 720, 1000, 1440 and 2000 nM). Cell growth occurred in all wells at 250 nM, and was absent at 2000 nM. From 500 through 1440 nM there were progressively fewer resistant clones present. 422 mutations representing 16 different sites were identified. EML4-ALK F1245C was found at 500 nM crizotinib, and was among the 10 most frequently observed mutations. Ba/F3 cells with unaltered EML4-ALK had crizotinib IC50 values for viability of 132 +/- 45 nM. EML4-ALK F1245C clones from the selection assay had IC50 viability value of 425 +/- 100 nM, while Ba/F3 cells expressing reintroduced EML4-ALK F1245C had IC50 value of 269 +/- 194 nM.

ALK	238	ALK FUSION I1171	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Alectinib (CH5424802)	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	A 51 year old female never-smoker was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with liver metastases. ALK rearrangement was verified via FISH. She was treated with crizotinib at 250 mg twice daily but discontinued due to adverse response. She then started alectinib at 600 mg twice daily with partial response, but new liver metastases then formed at 5 months. Liver tumor biopsy was performed and was estimated to be 15% tumor tissue. Next-generation sequencing discovered an ALK I1171N mutation. The tumor was not sequenced prior to alectinib resistance.

The I1171T ALK kinase domain mutation was found in this cell line (established after alectinib resistance). MGH056-1 cells were resistant to crizotinib (IC50 236nmol/L; aproximately 50x higher than for ceritinib). About 50 fold higher concentration of crizotinib was required to inhibit Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4 ALK I1171T than was required for EML4 ALK wild-type.

Tumors from mice with EML4-ALK variant 3 H2228 NSCLC cell xenografts which had progressed after approximately 40 days of crizotinib treatment were sequenced for ALK mutations. I1171T was found as one of 6 ALK resistance mutations from 80 sequenced tumors.

ALK	238	ALK FUSION I1171	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Ceritinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from an NSCLC patient with ALK-rearrangement who had progressed on crizotinib and then on alectinib. the cell line was also resistant to crizotinib and alectinib, and sequencing of ALK from the cell line revealed the I1171T mutation. Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Finally, administration of ceritinib to the crizotinib and alectinib resistant patient let to tumor regression and partial response lasting 7 months.

Brigatinib treatment of CLB-BAR cells reduced MYCN protein levels and ALK phosphorylation (Y1604) similar to crizotnib. Brigatinib reduced CLB-BAR cellular proliferation more effectively than crizotinib (IC50 75.2 vs 186.4nM). CLB-BAR xenografts in BalbC/NUDE mice responded to brigatinib with reduced tumor volume and weight (N=8/group) as well as reduced ALK phosphorylation and MYCN levels compared to untreated controls.

AKT1	207	E17K	Cancer	162	AZD-5363	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	AKT1 E17K mutations are oncogenic and occur in many cancers at a low prevalence. We performed a multihistology basket study of AZD5363. 58 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of 5 lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months , 6.6 months and 4.2 months in patients with ER+ breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively. In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response. Responses were not restricted to patients with detectable AKT1 E17K in pretreatment cfDNA.

In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKIs (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

BRAF	673	MUTATION	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Prognostic	Supports	Better Outcome	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) often identifies mutations with unclear clinical or prognostic implications. One such example is BRAF mutations that occur outside of codon 600 (non-V600 BRAF mutations). A multicenter, retrospective cohort study to characterize the clinical, pathologic, and survival implications of non-V600 BRAF mutations in metastatic CRC. A total of 9,643 patients with metastatic CRC underwent NGS testing. We identified 208 patients with non-V600 BRAF mutations, which occurred in 2.2% of all patients tested and accounted for 22% of all BRAF mutations identified. Cancers with non-V600 BRAF mutations, compared with cancers with V600E mutations, were found in patients who were significantly younger (58 v 68 years, respectively), fewer female patients (46% v 65%, respectively), and patients who had fewer high-grade tumors (13% v 64%, respectively) or right-sided primary tumors (36% v 81%, respectively). Median overall survival was significantly longer in patients with non-V600 BRAF-mutant metastatic CRC compared with those with both V600E BRAF-mutant and wild-type BRAF metastatic CRC (60.7 v 11.4 v 43.0 months).

Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations.

BRAF	673	V600	Colorectal Cancer	9256	Trametinib,Dabrafenib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In clinical trial NCT01072175, 43 patients with BRAF V600 metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) received mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib. Only 12% of patients showed  partial response or better, with one complete response lasting 36 months and ongoing after data cutoff. 56% of patients achieved stable disease. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, longer than the median PFS (2.5 months) reported for metastatic CRC treated with standard chemotherapy. The authors conclude that MAPK targeting in CRC is a valid approach that can produce meaningful responses but additional work is required to more effectively inhibit the pathway.

Palbociclib caused Rb dephosphorylation in MCL cell lines and patient derived tumor cells. MCL cell lines overexpressing cyclin D1 showed growth inhibition with Palbociclib. The VAL DLBCL cell line was used as control to verify cyclin D1 overexpression but was not used as a control in Palbociclib inhibitor experiments. Instead, the investigators report that other publications report cell lines without cyclin D1 overexpression had higher IC50 values for palbociclib, suggesting overexpresssed cyclin D1 targetability in MCL.

Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin Ds. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.

One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.

CEBPA	1050	N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119	OICR-9429	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	This preclinical study establishes that the p30 isoform of CEBPA expressed as a result of N-terminal truncating mutations preferentially interacts with WRD5, a component of the SET/MLL complex. Knockdown of WRD5 in 32D cells (mouse hematopoietic cell line) or transplanted primary mouse bone marrow expressing the p30 isoform restored myeloid differentiation in these cells. OICR-9429, a small molecule inhibitor of WRD5, and anti-WRD5 siRNAs selectively inhibited colony formation of mouse fetal liver cells homozygous for N-terminal CEBPA mutations but not wildtype colony formation. Finally, OICR-9429 reduced viability of primary human AML blasts harboring N-terminal domain CEBPA mutations in culture but not AML blasts with other mutations. Taken together, WRD5 inhibition is a potential therapeutic method for patients harboring N-terminal CEBPA mutations.

The authors investigated whether phosphorylated EGFR could be a potential predictive biomarker in patients with wild-type EGFR. Phosphorylation of Y1068 (assessed by IHC) was associated with improved progression free survival (PFS) in 205 patients with stage IIb and IV NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib) compared to phospho-Y1068 negative patients (median PFS 7.0 months vs. 1.2 months, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In this group, 92 (44.9%) were EGFR mutant. In a subgroup of patients with wild-type EGFR, phospho-Y1068 expression positive patients had a significantly prolonged PFS (4.2\u2009months vs.1.2\u2009months P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with those without phospho-Y1068 expression.

EGFR	1956	L858R	Cancer	162	Erlotinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	MCF-7 cells were transduced with YFP tagged EGFR with E746_A750delELREA mutation, or YFP EGFR wildtype, and stained for ectopic YFP EGFR and phospho-Akt as a readout for EGFR pathway activity. Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.

EGFR	1956	T790M	Lung Cancer	1324	Gefitinib,AEE788	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	Lung cancers can accumulate activating mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR. The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional gatekeeper mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.

Cells with an EGFR L858R/T790M mutation demonstrated an improved response to canertinib (IC50: 101nM vs. >4000nM) compared to the same cells treated with erlotinib. IC50 values of canertinib were comparable to afatinib.

EGFR	1956	T790M	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Brigatinib, Panitumumab, Cetuximab	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the C797S/T790M/activating-mutation (triple-mutation)-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance to Osimertinib. In the present study, we identify brigatinib to be effective against triple-mutation-harbouring cells in vitro and in vivo. The efficacy of brigatinib is enhanced markedly by combination with anti-EGFR antibodies Ceutximab or Panitumumab because of the decrease of surface and total EGFR expression. Thus, the combination therapy of brigatinib with anti-EGFR antibody is a powerful candidate to overcome triple-mutant EGFR.

Patients with EGFR deletions in exon 19 or L858R mutations were associated with an improved response to erlotinib or gefitinib with partial or complete response (74.1% vs. 16.5%, P<0.001) when compared to wildtype EGFR patients. Additionally, tumors with EGFR mutations in L858R or deletions in exon 19 were associated with increased overall survival (19.6mo vs. 10.4mo) compared to wildtype (all patients were treated with either erlotinib or gefitinib). From 61 patients with uncommon EGFR mutations of unknown clinical significance, 47.5% were responders in contrast to the 74.1% responders in the exon 19 deletion/L858R group.

EGFR	1956	C797S	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Brigatinib, Panitumumab, Cetuximab	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the C797S/T790M/activating-mutation (triple-mutation)-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance to Osimertinib. In the present study, we identify brigatinib to be effective against triple-mutation-harbouring cells in vitro and in vivo. The efficacy of brigatinib is enhanced markedly by combination with anti-EGFR antibodies Ceutximab or Panitumumab because of the decrease of surface and total EGFR expression. Thus, the combination therapy of brigatinib with anti-EGFR antibody is a powerful candidate to overcome triple-mutant EGFR.

Three patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas bearing mutations in the kinase domain of HER2 gene were identified (Y772_A775dup, G776L, and G778_P780dup). Objective response was observed in all three of these patients. The patient with G778_P780dup (Case 3 in the paper), had a rapid clinical and symptomatic response to Afatinib and stable disease which lasted for 3 months. Progressive disease at 4 months led to the addition of paclitaxel, resulting in partial response. Total Afatinib treatment was 15 months (11 in combination) at which time the patient developed a brain metastasis but no other progressive disease.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Endometrial Cancer	1380	Trastuzumab	Predictive	Does Not Support	Sensitivity	This phase II single arm study assessed trastuzumab monotherapy in HER2 positive endometrial cancers with tumor response as primary endpoint.  Participants had stage III, IV or recurrent HER2 positive endometrial cancer.  During the trials initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status.  In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted.  The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study.  28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies.  The investigators note that in other HER2 cancers, such as breast and gastrointestinal, trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been found most effective, and could warrant more study.  Currently a clinical trial (NCT01367002) is evaluating carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in uterine serous cancer.

In the first case, a 50 pack-year patient showed intense non-mutant HER2 expression by IHC without DNA amplification, and had undergone multiple prior lines of treatment.  With induction of trastuzumab and irinotecan treatment, tumor regression was observed with progression free survival of 4.5 months.  Case 2 involved a 68 year old never-smoker with relapsed SCLC.  Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation.  Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months.  While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Breast Cancer	1612	Pertuzumab,Trastuzumab,Docetaxel	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	CLEOPATRA (NCT00567190) was a Phase III, randomized and double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.  Patients were HER2-positive by IHC3+ or FISH, and patients who had received prior hormonal treatment or adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapy with or without trastuzumab for longer than 12 months before randomization were also eligible.  The two arms of the study were trastuzumab and docetaxel with either placebo or pertuzumab.  Median PFS in the placebo arm was 12.4 months while in the petuzumab arm 18.5 months was achieved.  Median OS in the control arm was 40.8 months and 56.5 months with pertuzumab.  These strong results make a case for dual antibody blockade in first line treatments of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Breast Cancer	1612	Lapatinib,Trastuzumab	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In light of results showing increased PFS using mAB plus TKI in heavily pretreated patients, the efficacy of trastuzumab plus lapatinib in a neoadjuvant setting with untreated stage II or IIIA HER2 positive breast cancer was assessed.  In this randomized 3 arm phase II study (CHER-LOB), patients received (A) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, (B) chemotherapy plus lapatinib, or (C) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and lapatinib, with pathologic complete response (pCR) as endpoint.  From 121 patients, pCR rates were 25% in arm A, 26.3% in arm B, and 46.7% in arm C.  The authors conclude these results support the superiority of dual-HER2 inhibition in the neoadjuvant context of HER2 positive BC.

In this study of HER2 positive metastatic BC which had progressed on trastuzumab, two arms were compared: lapatinib vs. lapatinib + trastuzumab. Progression free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. For 296 patients, 148 in each arm, median PFS of 8.1 weeks for lapatinib and 12.0 for combination therapy was observed (P=0.008).  The authors conclude that in the context of metastatic trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive BC, trastuzumab with lapatinib TKI addition is a favorable treatment.

It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169  to trastuzumab + vinorelbine.  Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group.  Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Uterine Corpus Serous Adenocarcinoma	5750	Trastuzumab	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	HER2 expression in uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) is thought to be associated with poor prognosis and may act as a targetable driver mutation in this cancer.  HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.  The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC.

Patients had 12 weeks or greater previous trastuzumab treatment with time since end of last cycle less than 6 weeks.  Primary endpoint was time to progression.  78 patients were assigned to each group, with median time to progression of 5.6 months in capecitabine group and 8.2 months in trastuzumab plus capecitabine group.

Patients were required to have prior exposure to trastuzumab and lapatinib as well as a taxane.  This patient population has not seen many studies, responds poorly to late-line treatment with trastuzumab, and in this study was treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=404) vs. physicians choice (usually trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=198).  Results showed progression free survival was 6.2 months in T-DM1 treatment vs. 3.3 months under physicians choice, along with lower incidence of grade 3 or worse events with T-DM1.  The authors conclude that their findings in this heavily pretreated population, along with findings in the EMILIA trial, indicate promise for antibody-drug conjugates.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Gastric Adenocarcinoma	3717	Trastuzumab	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	ToGA, a Phase III study (NCT01041404) addressed use of trastuzumab in HER2 positive (overexpression or amplification) advanced gastric cancer, where chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based combinations had been common practice.  Patients were given a chemotherapy regime containing capecitabine, flourouracil and cisplatin with (n=298) or without (n=296) trastuzumab, and had not been previously treated for metastatic cancer.  Study endpoint was overall survival, which was significantly different in the two populations (13.8 months with chemotherapy + trastuzumab and 11.1 months for chemotherapy alone).  The authors conclude that trastuzumab should be a standard option for HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer.

Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Colorectal Cancer	9256	Cetuximab	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	We identified 142 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors harbored both wild-type exons 2, 3, and 4 in KRAS and NRAS, and wild-type exon 15 in BRAF. All patients received cetuximab after oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluoropyrimidine failure. HER2 status was determined using immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization and correlated with cetuximab efficacy. Of 142 RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors, we observed 7 cases (4.9%) of HER2 amplification by SISH. After a median follow-up of 13.2 months (range, 1.4-78.1 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly different according to HER2 status: 3.1 months in patients with HER2 amplification compared with 5.6 months in those with non-amplified HER2 (HR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.18-6.31; P = 0.019). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between groups, although there was a tendency towards shorter OS in patients with HER2-amplified tumors (HR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.61-2.82; 10.1 vs. 13.5 months; P = 0.488).

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Uterine Corpus Serous Adenocarcinoma	5750		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	In a study of 27 African American and caucasian patients, endometrial adenocarcinoma samples were assessed for HER2 via IHC staining, and association studies were performed using corresponding patient information.  Earlier deaths were seen with heavier HER2 expression.  Multivariate Cox regression indicated that shorter survival was associated with higher HER2 expression, and not with age or ethnicity, and that observed differences in survival rates between ethnicities can be ascribed to higher rates of HER2 overexpression in African American patients.  The authors conclude that high HER2 expression in USPC is associated with poor outcome and explains observed differences in outcome between ethnicities.

ESR1	2099	OVEREXPRESSION	Breast Cancer	1612	Palbociclib (PD0332991),Letrozole	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	A phase 2 clinical trial evaluated 165 patients with oestrogen receptor positive and HER2-negative breast cancer such that 84 patients received combination therapy of palbociclib plus letrozole and 81 patients received letrozole alone. The combination therapy arm had higher median duration of progression-free survival when compared to the letrozole only group (20.2 months vs. 10.2 months; p<0.0004). A subcategory of patients taking combination therapy, who lacked mutations in p16 or CCND1 (n=34), had an even higher median free survival of 26.1 months.  Noticeable side effects in the combination therapy group included neutropenia (54%) leucopenia (19%), fatigue (4%) back pain (2%), diarrhea (2%) and pulmonary embolism (4%).

They detected a targetable fusion between exon 18 of FGFR3 and exon 11 of TACC3 at a frequency of 1.4% (1/74) in ESCC, whereas other FGFR fusions were not detected in the ESCC or GC specimens analyzed. Furthermore, split FGFR3 signals were apparent in this specimen by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with break-apart probes. The patient, a 64-year-old man with unresectable T4bN3M1 poorly differentiated ESCC of stage IV, was treated with palliative chemoradiotherapy followed by taxane chemotherapy. The patient died of cancer progression, with his overall survival time having been 9.5 months.\nThey have identified a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion with a certain breakpoint in ESCC using the most comprehensive panel for FGFR fusion transcript detection reported to date.

IDH2	3418	MUTATION	Brain Glioma	0060108	Olaparib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2, which result in overproduction of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG is considered to be an oncometabolite, or a metabolite that promotes carcinogenesis, and inhibitors of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase are in development to target this process. The authors discovered that 2HG overproduction impairs homologous recombination used in DNA repair and sensitizes cancer cells to treatment with PARP inhibitors, another class of cancer drugs that are already in clinical use.

Baseline biopsies were obtained before therapy initiation with pembrolizumab. A JAK2 F547 splice site mutation was observed at the time of relapse in patient 2. RNA sequencing revealed an in-frame stop codon after exon 12. The JAK2 mutation was the only homozygous mutation (allele frequency >85%) of 76 new nonsynonymous mutations in patient 2. Cell line modelling of baseline and relapse JAK2 mutational status revealed a loss of response to interferon gamma and  loss of JAK2 protein.

KIT	3815	D816H	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253	Imatinib	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	147 patients with advanced, unresectable GISTs were enrolled onto a randomized, phase II clinical study of imatinib (CSTI571-B2222). Specimens from 43 pretreatment and/or imatinib-resistant tumors were analyzed to identify molecular correlates of imatinib resistance. D816H was observed as a secondary KIT mutation in two patients with secondary imatinib resistance. The mutation was shown to occur at a hotspot (D816) of previously reported secondary KIT mutations in imatinib resistant GISTs. When co-expressed with V560D (imatinib sensitive) in vitro D816H showed extreme imatinib resistance. It was also highly resistant in isolation.

KIT	3815	K642E	Melanoma	1909		Prognostic	Supports	Better Outcome	A 69 y.o. woman presented with metastatic mucuosal melanoma of the anus. KIT was amplified in the tumor and harbored the K642E mutation. Post surgery with extensive margins, she was given a dose of anti-CTLA-4 antibody and adjuvant radiation therapy for 2.5 weeks.  Two weeks post radiation she developed nodules in the same region and testing indicated they were malignant melanoma with high KIT expression. She enrolled in a clinical trial with a dose of 400mg imatinib per day (Nov 2006). Less than 4 weeks later, all nodules had disappeared. Upon a lowered dosage to 200mg of imatinib, the nodules returned and subsequently the dosage was increased to 600mg/day. The patient remained melanoma-free on 600mg imatinib until a follow up in Jan 2008. The authors do not provide further details on patient outcome.

Cell viability was evaluated following knockdown of 834 genes in isogenic LIM1215 colorectal cancer cell lines harboring wildtype (parental), G12S, G12D or G12V KRAS. 6 targets identified by this screen were evaluated in a second set of isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines (SW48) harboring wildtype (parental), G12S, G12D, G12V or G13D KRAS where only CDK1 knockdown more profoundly reduced survival in mutant cells compared to wildtype. Results were validated in 5 KRAS mutant (BRAF WT) and 10 KRAS WT colorectal cancer cell lines. Chemical inhibition of CDK1 by AZD5438 in KRAS mutant vs WT pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines showed increased efficacy in mutant cell lines.

KRAS	3845	MUTATION	Cancer	162	GDC-0623,G-573	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Preclinical study analyzing the differential response to MEK Inhibitors in KRAS and BRAF mutant cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. Efficacy of MEK inhibitors (GDC-0623 and G-573) in KRAS-driven tumours is mediated by a hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. This mechanism was distinct from GDC-0973 which is less potent in KRAS mutant tumors. Overall, this work indicates that MEK inhibitors with this mechanism of action will be most effective in patients with both BRAF and KRAS mutations.

KRAS	3845	MUTATION	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Pembrolizumab	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In this study we investigated the correlation between PD-L1 expression and KRAS mutation and the functional significance of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. We found that PD-L1 expression was associated with KRAS mutation both human  cell lines and tissues. KRAS-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1 induced the apoptosis of CD3-positive T cells which was reversed by anti-PD-1 antibody (Pembrolizumab) or ERK inhibitor. However, Pembrolizumab combined with ERK inhibitor did not show synergistic effect. The study demonstrated that KRAS mutation could induce PD-L1 expression through p-ERK signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy for human KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.

KRAS	3845	MUTATION	Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma	3908	Trametinib	Predictive	Does Not Support	Sensitivity	In this phase II trial, trametinib or docetaxel was given to patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (HR 1.14; p = 0.5197). Median OS, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; P = 0.934).

Of 3 eligible studies using either nivolumab or atezolizumab, 138 patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC and 371 with KRAS wild-type were included. ICI improved overall survival over that with docetaxel in KRAS mutant, previously-treated advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio=0.64 [95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.96], P = 0.03) but not in those with KRAS wild-type tumor (HR = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.68-1.13], P = 0.30).

KRAS	3845	G13	Multiple Myeloma	9538		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	In a retrospective study of 439 patients with multiple myeloma enrolled in a clinical trial, 28 had mutations in KRAS (22/28 in G12/G13). Those with KRAS (but not NRAS) mutations had worse overall (median 19.9 vs 44.3 months, p=0.005) and progression free survival (median 14.7 vs 30.3 months, p<0.001) than those without mutations.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKIs like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.

KRAS	3845	G12C	Cancer	162	ARS-853,EGFR Inhibitor	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Preclinical study to investigate mechanisms of KRAS G12C activity and inhibition with ARS-853, a covalent (irreversible) inhibitor which binds KRAS G12C in the GDP-bound state to prevent activation. Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a \u201chyperexcitable\u201d rather than a \u201cstatically active\u201d state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset  (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay.  Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF.

MAP2K1	5604	K57N	Lung Adenocarcinoma	3910	Selumetinib (AZD6244)	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Mutational profiling of a large cohort of lung adenocarcinomas  identified in 2 of 207 primary lung tumors a somatic activating mutation in exon 2 of MEK1 (i.e., mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 or MAP2K1) that substitutes asparagine for lysine at amino acid 57 (K57N) in the nonkinase portion of the kinase. Neither of these two tumors harbored known mutations in other genes encoding components of the EGFR signaling pathway (i.e., EGFR, HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF). Expression of mutant, but not wild-type, MEK1 leads to constitutive activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 in human 293T cells and to growth factor-independent proliferation of murine Ba/F3 cells. A selective MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, inhibits mutant-induced ERK activity in 293T cells and growth of mutant-bearing Ba/F3 cells.

Selumetinib treatment in a phase-II trial led to a complete and durable response > 5 years. Sequencing (MSK-IMPACT Panel) was performed on the patients tumor and germline and identified a 15-bp in-frame deletion of MAP2K1 (8.3% of tumor reads but 0% in germline). In-silico modelling suggested loss of negative feedback on kinase activity from this deletion.In-vitro expression of the MEK1 Q56_V60 deletion as well as the previously characterized MEK1 F53L mutation in 293H cells resulted in elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase as compared with wild-type MEK1 as well as increased colony formation and tumor growth in-vivo.

The test development cohort consisted of 194 cases and an independent validation cohort consisted of 91 cases. Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle. This persistence was associated with a greater risk of relapse after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001).

PIK3CA	5290	E545K	Colorectal Cancer	9256	Aspirin	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA) is composed of an 85kDa regulatory subunit and a 110kDa (p110alpha) catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositols (PI), PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. The p110alpha binds to receptors associated with multiple growth factors, including PDGF and EGF, which then catalyzes phosphorylation of PI 3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) into 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). One critical downstream target of this signaling pathway is the activation of protein-Ser/Thr kinase (AKT)-1, which subsequently affects multiple cellular processes, including increased cellular proliferation or decreased apoptosis, and contributes to tumorigenesis.

PIK3CA	5290	H1047R	Colorectal Cancer	9256	Aspirin	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA) is composed of an 85kDa regulatory subunit and a 110kDa (p110alpha) catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositols (PI), PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. The p110alpha binds to receptors associated with multiple growth factors, including PDGF and EGF, which then catalyzes phosphorylation of PI 3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) into 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). One critical downstream target of this signaling pathway is the activation of protein-Ser/Thr kinase (AKT)-1, which subsequently affects multiple cellular processes, including increased cellular proliferation or decreased apoptosis, and contributes to tumorigenesis.

PIK3CA	5290	E542K	Colorectal Cancer	9256	Aspirin	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA) is composed of an 85kDa regulatory subunit and a 110kDa (p110alpha) catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositols (PI), PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. The p110alpha binds to receptors associated with multiple growth factors, including PDGF and EGF, which then catalyzes phosphorylation of PI 3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) into 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). One critical downstream target of this signaling pathway is the activation of protein-Ser/Thr kinase (AKT)-1, which subsequently affects multiple cellular processes, including increased cellular proliferation or decreased apoptosis, and contributes to tumorigenesis.

In the BOLERO trials, patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab, chemotherapy and randomized to receive either everolimus or placebo. In the pooled analysis of both trials, patients with PI3K mutations had longer progression-free survival with everolimus compared to placebo (HR 0.67 95%CI 0.45 to 1.00, P=0.05) whereas patients with PI3K wild type status did not benefit significantly (HR 1.1, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.46, P=0.5). The same was found when PI3K mutations, PTEN loss and AKT E17K mutations were combinedly analyzed as hyperactive PI3K pathway. Patients with PI3K hyperactive pathway had a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) compared to HR 1.19 (95%CI 0.87 to 1.62, P=0.28) in patients with PI3K normal pathway. These trends were independently confirmed in both trials but only pooled results showed consistent statistical significance.

R173C resides in the NH2-terminal phosphatase domain of PTEN. R173C was one of four mutations (out of 42 tested) that displayed no significant phosphatase activity against either substrate, indicating, by this assay, that the mutation negatively impacts the function of PTEN.   However this mutation did not affect the ability of PTEN to bind lipid membranes in-vivo.  This data justifies PS3 level evidence for pathogenicity according to ACMG guidelines.

Vandetanib induced tumor regression in PDX models with high expression of RET or EGFR. The effect was associated with inhibition of RET/EGFR phosphorylation and MAP kinase pathway and increased necrosis. In a PDX model with no expression of RET nor EGFR, Vandetanib slowed tumor growth without inducing tumor regression. In addition, treatment by Vandetanib decreased expression of murine Vegf receptors and the endothelial marker Cd31 in the four PDX models tested, suggesting inhibition of tumor vascularization.

RET	5979	C609Y	Thyroid Medullary Carcinoma	3973		Predisposing	Supports	Pathogenic	Study of a family with three generations of history indicating co-segregation of RET C609Y and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, many of whom exhibited medullary thyroid cancers specifically.  22 individuals in this family were carriers of C609Y. Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically.  The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants. Based on this paper, the following ACMG evidence codes seem potentially valid: PS1, PS3,  PM5, PP1, PP4, and PP5.

TP53	7157	P47S	Cancer	162	Cisplatin	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	The P47S (rs1800371) variant of TP53 is observed in 1.5% in African Americans and between 6% and 8% in certain African populations but has not been detected in Caucasian Americans. This paper reports functional studies of this variant. Mouse models with this variant show an increase in spontaneous tumor formation. 16 out of 20 (80%) of S47 homozygous mice developed cancer between 12 and 18 months of age. Cancers predominantly included hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as other\ntumor types. In S47/wild-type heterozygote mice an increased cancer incidence, with a predisposition for hepatocellular carcinoma, was also found. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with S47 mutations were significantly less sensitive to cisplatinum treatment compared to TP53 wild-type cells (apoptosis and viability).

MET	4233	OVEREXPRESSION	Uveal Melanoma	6039	MET Inhibition, ErbB3 Inhibition	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	MEK inhibitors improve survival in cutaneous melanoma patients but show only modest efficacy in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. In this study, we screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib. We show that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Individually targeting ERBB3 and cMET, the receptors for NRG1 and HGF, respectively, overcome resistance to trametinib provided by these growth factors and by conditioned medium from fibroblasts that produce NRG1 and HGF. Together, these results provide preclinical evidence for the use of MEK inhibitors in combination with clinical-grade anti-ERBB3 or anti-cMET monoclonal antibodies in metastatic uveal melanoma.

Methylome analysis revealed three CpG clusters (C1\u20133) with differential methylation to be negatively correlated with differential c-MET mRNA expression. In nearly all (90%) pairwise comparisons of tumors and cell lines, differential c-MET mRNA expression could be accounted for by at least one differential CpG cluster methylation (\u0394\u03b2 \u2265 10% and FDR adjusted p \u2264 0.05). In contrast, only 48% displayed a concordant differential expression pattern of at least one c-MET transcription factor. In an independent study, c-MET was overexpressed in 8 of 35 (23%) MAPKi-resistant tumors from 7 of 26 (27%) patients.

Combined EGFR and BRAF inhibition (panitumumab and vemurafenib) showed an initial partial response for 4 months. Re-biopsy at the time of progression showed a MET amplification and overexpression (IHC, ISH) but no secondary mutations in candidate resistance genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1). MET amplification was also present in a subset of tumor cells in the pretreatment sample. MET amplification was also identified in 3/17 (18%) chemonaive BRAF V600E colorectal cancer tumor tissues.\nOverexpression of MET in a BRAF mutant CRC cell line (WiDr) confered resistance to combined vemurafenib and panitumumab. The addition of crizotinib to this combination restored sensitivity in vitro.\nThe patient was started on combined vemurafenib and crizotinib in January 2016 and had a metabolic, clinical and tumor marker response that was ongoing at the time of publication (06/16) without significant toxicity.

VHL	7428	L158fs (c.473insT)	Von Hippel-Lindau Disease	14175		Predisposing	Supports	Uncertain Significance	Molecular analysis of VHL gene in 146 probands, 103 with and 43 without a positive family history, resulted in the detection of 43 germline VHL mutations. Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This mutation causes an early sop codon at amino acid 173 and was found in a VHL type 1 family with 8 patients. Six family members had retinal hemangioblastomas, 2 had cerebellar hemangioblastomas, 7 renal cell carcinoma, and 4 pancreatic cysts (family no. 29). ACMG codes as follows: Protein length changes as a result of in-frame insertion in a nonrepeat region (PM4). Cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease (PP1).

Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This mutation was found in 2 VHL family members with retinal hemangioblastomas (family no.13).

VHL	7428	L158P (c.473T>C)	Von Hippel-Lindau Disease	14175		Predisposing	Supports	Likely Pathogenic	In this study of the VHL gene product (pVHL), wild-type pVHL was found to bind to 2 cellular proteins (designated p10 and p14 respectively) of 10 and 14 kilodaltons long consistently in vitro and in vivo. Mutant pVHL with missense mutation at codon 158 eliminated or reduced the ability of pVHL to bind p10/p14. The frequency of mutations affecting the p10/p14-binding region suggests that maintenance of integrity of the p10/p14-binding region is essential for cellular growth regulation function of pVHL. Only moderate evidence for pathogenicity because mutation is located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain without benign variation (ACMG code: PM1).

VHL	7428	R167Q (c.500G>A)	Von Hippel-Lindau Disease	14175		Predisposing	Supports	Uncertain Significance	This paper describes the clinical and genetic findings of 36 Spanish pediatric patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Genetic testing involved sequencing and MLPA of VHL, RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, TMEM127, and MAX. The molecular analysis identified 8 patients with variants in the VHL gene. The above mutation was found in 2 patients; one had pheochromocytoma, retinal hemangioblastoma, and CNS hemangioblastoma (onset age 12) while the other had bilateral pheochromocytoma (onset age 15). Both patients were noted to have been previously reported, although it is not specified where. ACMG evidence codes: PP2 because they observe a missense variant in a gene where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease, PP4 because the patients phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology. Relevant HPO terms: Hemangioblastoma, Retinal hemangioblastoma, Pheochromocytoma.

VHL	7428	R167Q (c.500G>A)	Von Hippel-Lindau Disease	14175		Predisposing	Supports	Likely Pathogenic	In this study of the VHL gene product (pVHL), wild-type pVHL was found to bind to 2 cellular proteins (designated p10 and p14 respectively) of 10 and 14 kilodaltons long consistently in vitro and in vivo. Mutant pVHL with missense mutation at codon 167 eliminated or reduced the ability of pVHL to bind p10/p14 in vitro. The frequency of mutations affecting the p10/p14-binding region suggests that maintenance of integrity of the p10/p14-binding region is essential for cellular growth regulation function of pVHL. Only moderate evidence for pathogenicity because mutation is located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain without benign variation (ACMG code: PM1).

CTNNB1	1499	T41A	Desmoid Fibromatosis	None		Diagnostic	Supports	Positive	Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare, nonmetastatic neoplasm marked by local invasiveness and relentless recurrence. Beta-Catenin deregulation has been commonly identified in sporadic desmoids.\nCTNNB1 mutations were observed in 117 of 138 (85%) of desmoids. Three discrete mutations in two codons of CTNNB1 exon 3 were identified: T41A (59%), S45F (33%), and S45P (8%). Five-year recurrence-free survival was significantly poorer in S45F-mutated desmoids (23%, P < 0.0001) versus either T41A (57%) or nonmutated tumors (65%).\nIn conclusion, CTNNB1 mutations are highly common in desmoid tumors. Furthermore, patients harboring CTNNB1 (45F) mutations are at particular risk for recurrence and therefore may especially benefit from adjuvant therapeutic approaches.

CYP2D6	1565	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	Breast Cancer	1612		Prognostic	Does Not Support	Poor Outcome	Meta-analysis of 25 studies involving 13,629 women with tamoxifen treated breast cancer. The meta-analysis investigated the association between CYP2D6 genotypes and response to tamoxifen treatment (loss/reduced function vs. unchanged/increased function). The authors examine a prevailing hypothesis that individuals carrying a reduced function CYP2D6 allele have poorer outcomes due to less metabolism of tamoxifen to active metabolites. The study concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support use of CYP2D6 genotyping as a guide for tamoxifen use in breast cancer.

Paired samples containing tumor were obtained for 98% (118 of 121). Ki67 fell significantly with lapatinib,, but not with placebo (-3%).

Cancerogenesis with chemical initiators/promoters (3-methylcholanthrene or control, butylated hydroxytoluene) was assessed in mice lacking Ereg (Ereg-/-) and wildtype controls (BALB/ByJ; Ereg+/+) at multiple time points and endpoints (bronchoalveolar lavage analysis, tumor analysis, mRNA expression, ELISA, wound assay). Initially a significantly reduced amount of inflammation (macrophages, PMNs) was observed in the Ereg-/- mice. At 20\u2009wk, tumor multiplicity was also significantly decreased in the Ereg-/- mice.

A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft.

These fusions have been described in histologically distinctive soft tissue tumours showing a pericytic phenotype.  Gene fusions retain the DNA-binding zinc finger domains of GLI1 and it is likely that the replacement of the promoter region of GLI1with that of the ubiquitously expressed ACTB gene leads to deregulation of GLI expression and its downstream target genes.

Univariate analysis identified gender, smoking history, histology and GNAS1 T393C polymorphism as predictive marker of PFS (P=0.04, P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.005). Multivariate analysis of factors, including smoking history, performance status score, histology, GNAS1 T393C polymorphism demonstrated that GNAS1 T393C polymorphism was correlated independently with PFS (P=0.007).

LEPR	3953	UNDEREXPRESSION	Meningioma	3565		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	144 cases (discovery set: N=62 discovery; Independent validation set: N = 82) of meningiomas were analyzed for transcriptional features defining aggressive clinical course (recurrent, malignantly progressing or WHO grade III). Meningiomas were categorized into non-recurrent (NR), recurrent (R), and tumors undergoing malignant progression (M). Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis in 62 meningiomas revealed a large set of differentially expressed genes in aggressive subgroups (R+M tumors and WHO grade III, n=332; p<0.01, FC>1.25). Multivariate analysis identified PTTG1 and LEPR mRNA expression independent of gender, WHO grade and extent of resection. The patient group with the longest PFS was characterized by co-occurrence of low PTTG1 and high LEPR mRNA expression. IHC in 36 tumors validated these results on protein level.

PTEN and PIK3CA mutations were heavily represented in the panel. However, a PTEN and PIK3CA wild type cell line HS578T was found to harbor a mutation in the PI3K regulatory protein PIK3R1. Like PIK3CA mutant cell lines, the PIK3R1 mutant HS578T line was also determined to be sensitive to PP242. Approximately 70% of PIK3CA wild type lines were not sensitive to PP242. This suggests that mutations in the PI3K holoenzyme may be targetable by mTORC1/2 inhibition.

A biopsy of a resistant tumor showed an acquired G2032R mutation in the ROS1 kinase domain. Although this mutation does not lie at the gatekeeper residue, it confers resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through steric interference with drug binding. The same resistance mutation was observed at all the metastatic sites that were examined at autopsy, suggesting that this mutation was an early event in the clonal evolution of resistance.

RRM1	6240	UNDEREXPRESSION	Pancreatic Cancer	1793	Gemcitabine	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity	In this study, human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MiaPaCa2, which is a gemcitabine-sensitive cell line, was used for the establishment of chemoresistant cells MiaPaCa2-RG. Analysis for identifying genetic alterations relating to gemcitabine resistance revealed that RRM1 was the most upregulated gene with a 4.5 fold expression. RRM1-speci\ufb01c RNAi transfection significantly reduced the gemcitabine chemoresistance of MiaPaCa2-RG to the same level as that of gemcitabine sensitive MiaPaCa2. Moreover, gemcitabine response of MiaPaCa2 also became more sensitive.  Next, patients with pancreatic cancer were recruited and 18 tissue samples were taken. The patients with a low RRM1 expression had a significantly better outcome after gemcitabine treatment than those patients with high RRM1 expression (P=0.016).

SOX10	6663	LOSS	Melanoma	1909	Vemurafenib	Predictive	Supports	Resistance or Non-Response	FACS-assisted shRNA genetic screen identified SOX10 as a determinant of vemurafenib resistance. Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-\u03b2 becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.

Cytogenetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated the t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation in approximately 90% of both monophasic and biphasic synovial sarcomas. The fusion has clear diagnostic value, though the authors caution that it is not perfectly specific to synovial sarcomas, and suggest that demonstration of t(X;18) in a spindle cell neoplasm should be integrated with the morphology, immunoprofile, and clinical setting of the tumour.

In this study, we therefore investigated whether CXCR4 plays a role in the cisplatin associated resistance in NSCLC. We detected the expression of CXCR4 in tissue specimens from 64 NSCLC patients by immunohistochemistry. Cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells A549/DDP and its parental A549 cells were employed in this study. RNA interference was performed to silence the CXCR4. Finally, we found CXCR4 was significantly highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC patients and the A549/DDP cell line. CXCR4 inhibition by siRNA reversed chemoresistance and decreased tumor cell proliferation.

ARID1A	8289	UNDEREXPRESSION	Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma	4467		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	This study included 290 patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma whose tumor tissues were sampled and then analyzed. These samples were then divided according to ARID1A expression after immunohistochemical staining. Of the 290 patients, 213 had a low ARID1A expression and 77 patients had a high expression. There was a significant correlation between low ARID1A expression and large tumors as well as shorter survival. After a multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards, it was found that ARID1A expression levels are an independent predictor of progression-free survival in patients with CCRCC, although no significant correlation was found between the expression levels and cancer-specific survival.

ARID1A	8289	UNDEREXPRESSION	Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma	0050934		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	In this study, tissue sampling began with 77 ovarian cancer patients. Following, 60 of those samples, the patients withe clear cell ovarian cancer, were analyzed for ARID1A expression using immunohistochemistry.  Of those 60, 9 patients had a loss of ARID1A expression. Also, 17 high-grade serous adenocarcinomas were also analyzed and none of them showed a loss of ARID1A expression. The loss was more frequent in clear cell ovarian carcinoma than in the high-grade serous adenocarcinoma. Results showed that a low ARID1A expression was significantly related to advanced FIGO stages and high CAI25 levels (P=0.02). Those patients with a low expression experienced shorter progression free survival than those with no loss of expression (P<0.01). In a multivariate analysis it was found that a loss of ARID1A expression was significant for shorter disease free survival (P=0.03) and shorter overall survival for patients whose ovarian clear cell carcinoma was treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (P=0.015). Lastly, tumors with low expression were significantly more likely to be resistant to primary adjuvant chemotherapy than tumors with a higher expression (P=0.04).

ARID1A	8289	UNDEREXPRESSION	Stomach Cancer	10534		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	In this study, real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were used in 66 pairs of cancerous and matched adjacent normal tissues. In 43 of those pairs, the expression level of ARID1A was significantly lower in the cancerous tissue than in the normal tissue (P=0.0029). This was then again tested using Western Blotting. Consistent with the real-time PCR results, there was a lower expression of ARID1A in 13 of the tumor tissue samples compared to the normal tissue samples (P=0.0015). In an immunohistochemical analysis of 224 tissue blocks, 115 of those had a decreased ARID1A expression. The data conveyed that lower ARID1A expression was correlated with depth of tumor infiltration (P=0.001). Lastly, cell proliferation in regards to ARID1A expression was tested in cell lines. The cells with silenced expression of ARID1A had a much greater growth than those with greater expression of the protein.

Meningiomas were categorized into non-recurrent (NR), recurrent (R), and tumors undergoing malignant progression (M). Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis in 62 meningiomas revealed a large set of differentially expressed genes in aggressive subgroups (R+M tumors and WHO grade III, n=332; p<0.01, FC>1.25). Multivariate analysis identified PTTG1 and LEPR mRNA expression independent of gender, WHO grade and extent of resection.

MERTK inhibition via shRNA reduced MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, reduced colony formation by up to 59%, and diminished tumor volume by 60% in a human melanoma murine xenograft model. Treatment of melanoma cells with UNC1062, a novel MERTK-selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduced activation of MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, induced apoptosis in culture, reduced colony formation in soft agar, and inhibited invasion of melanoma cells.

In-vitro experiments confirmed that FOXP3 expression enhance anthracycline efficacy. The in vitro data consisted of testing the sensitivity of various breast cancer cell lines to anthracyclines after treatment with valproic acid (which increases FOXP3 expression). The authors observed that, while valproic acid has no intrinsic cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, it enhanced the cytotoxic effect of epirubicin specifically in cell lines where FOXP3 expression was increased.

A reciprocal relationship between FBXW7 or PTEN loss was identified in breast cancer tumors and cell lines (mutual exclusivity of these two events).  In total only 4 out of 450 tumor and cell line samples had concomitant loss of both genes (p=4.9x10^-7). Cell lines (n=5) with FBXW7 mutations or deletions were significantly sensitive to rapamycin and downregulation of FBXW7 (shRNA) increased the sensitivity to rapamycin. In summary, this evidence suggests that FBXW7 may be a biomarker for cancers sensitivity to inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.

MIR218-1	407000	UNDEREXPRESSION	Pancreatic Cancer	1793		Prognostic	Supports	Poor Outcome	The study found mir-218 was significantly under-expressed when compared to matched adjacent normal tissue in 107 samples via qPCR. Further, low expression of mir-218 was revealed to be associated with lower overall survival (p < .001), and multivariate analysis revealed that low expression of mir-218 as an independent predictor of poor prognosis (p < .007).

MIR218-1	407000	EXPRESSION	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Prognostic	Supports	Better Outcome	Researchers examined the prognostic role of miR-218 expression in CRC tumor samples when receiving 5-FU based treatment. CRC samples from patients who received first-line 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy were stratified into two groups (complete/partial response and stable/progressive disease) based on RECIST criteria. miR-218 expression levels were found to be significantly higher in the complete/partial response group.  Further Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that in groups with higher miR-218 expression, overall survival was significantly greater.

DUX4	100288687	DUX4 FUSIONS	Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia	9952		Diagnostic	Supports	Positive	A screen for fusion genes in Ph- AYA-ALL (Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adolescents and young adults) was performed using RNA-seq from multiple cohorts of ALL patients. DUX4, ZNF384 and MEF2D fusions were the most frequent found.  DUX4 fusions were found only in AYA cases (age 15-39) and this was significant, p=0.016. DUX4 fusions clustered into groups distinct from the other fusions, and these fusions as a whole clustered with Ph- ALL cases. The authors performed extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments to demonstrate that DUX4 fusions are likely early initiating/events and that DUX4 fusion and not DUX4 wild type are tumorigenic. The authors conclude that DUX4 fusions may be a target driver resulting in AYA-ALL, and that AYA-ALL may be a distinct clinical entity.

DUX4	100288687	DUX4 FUSIONS	Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia	9952		Prognostic	Supports	Better Outcome	Ph- ALL (Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia) gene expression profiles cluster into two main groups, Ph like and non-Ph like ALL.  Non-Ph like ALL have favorable outcomes when compared with Ph like ALL.  DUX4 fusions were discovered in a subset of Ph- ALL tumors through RNA-seq, and their mutation profile was found to cluster with non-Ph like ALL. It was found that patients with DUX4 fusions (N=9) had improved disease free survival over Ph like ALL patients (N=6) in the study. Eight years after complete remission, DUX4 fusion positive patients had over 0.8 disease free survival probability.
