Patients are predisposed to developing hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors; endolymphatic sac tumors; and epididymal and broad ligament cysts. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache, vomiting, gait disturbances, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL disease and can cause vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems, unless bilateral, in which case they may result in infertility.The VHL gene product encodes pVHL, which binds to elongin C, elongin B, cullin-2 and Rbx1. This complex catalyzes the polyubiquitinylation of specific proteins and targets them for degradation by proteosomes. For example, under normoxic conditions, hydroxylated hypoxia-inducble factor alpha subunits (HIFÃ_Â±) binds pVHL targets HIFÃ_Â± for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1Ã_Â± is not hydroxylated, pVHL does not bind, and HIF1Ã_Â± subunits accumulate. HIF1Ã_Â± forms heterodimers with HIF1Ã__ and activates transcription of a variety of hypoxia-inducible genes (i.e., VEGF, EPO, TGFÃ_Â±, PDGFÃ__). Likewise, when pVHL is absent or mutated, HIF1Ã_Â± subunits accumulate, resulting in cell proliferation and the neovascularization of tumors characteristic of VHL disease. Pathogenic variants in VHL either prevent its expression (i.e., deletions, frameshifts, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations) or lead to the expression of an abnormal protein (i.e., missense mutations). Missense mutations that destabilize packing of the alpha-helical domains, decrease the stability of the alpha-beta domain interface, interfere with binding of elongin C and HIF1Ã_Â±, or disrupt hydrophobic core residues result in loss of HIF regulation and are more likely to result in VHL type 1 (no predisposition to pheochromocytoma).  Missense mutations that result in pVHL that is normal with respect to HIF regulation are more likely to be associated with VHL with clinical pheochromocytoma. Acquired somatic pathogenic variants in VHL may give rise to sporadic VHL-type tumors (i.e., clear cell RCC and hemangioblastoma) without other associated tumors characteristic of the hereditary disease. It should be noted that >90% of the most common form of kidney cancer (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) are associated with bi-allelic somatic mutation in the VHL gene, and is the rationale for the anti-angiogenic therapy for RCC patients."

It has been observed to be expressed during embryonic development however expression attenuates after development in all but a few tissues. Research has indicated that over-expression of PAX proteins in general are not an initiating event in tumorgenesis however they may facilitate malignant development. PAX8 is expressed in 80-96% of all High-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) and is commonly used as a marker for the disease. In addition PAX8 has become a useful biomarker for differentiating between mullerian mucinous and non-mullerian tumors. PAX8 has also been associated with neoplasms in the kidney and thyroid.

The resulting fusion protein harbors the constitutively active ROS1 kinase domain and drives cellular proliferation (Davies et. al.). In NSCLC about 1% harbor a ROS1 rearrangement. These patients are predominantely female and have a lower T-stage (Warth et. al.). Treatment with crizotinib leads to a reported objective response rate of appr. 70% and a median duration of response of 18 months (Shaw et. al.). Resistance mechanisms to crizotinib have been described and involve mutations in the kinase domain. More selective inhibitors of ROS1 might overcome this resistance (Davare et. al.)."
