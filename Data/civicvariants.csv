1,ABL1,25,BCR-ABL,"The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.",4,variant,120,transcript_fusion,Transcript Fusion,SO:0001886,A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.,http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886,22,23522397,23632600,,,ENST00000305877.8,9,133729451,133763063,ENST00000318560.5,75,GRCh37,,,,,,

These hotspots, termed C228T and C250T are observed in many cancer types and have a particularly high prevalence in glioblastoma (83%), melanoma (71%), bladder cancer (66%) and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) (47%). The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors.

306,ERBB2,2064,AMPLIFICATION,"Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC.

425,KRAS,3845,G12V,KRAS mutations are the most common mutations in pancreatic cancer occurring in > 90% of cases. Of these the G12D activating mutation is the most prevalent and results in a loss of GTPase activity which in turn leads to a constitutively active form of KRAS.

499,ALK,238,ALK FUSIONS,"Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. 

In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. 

Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.   

ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",1,variant,120,transcript_fusion,Transcript Fusion,SO:0001886,A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.,http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886,2,29415640,29446394,,,ENST00000389048.3,,,,,75,GRCh37,,,,,,

1739,VHL,7428,R167Q (c.500G>A),R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2α. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.,58,variant,47,missense_variant,Missense Variant,SO:0001583,"A sequence variant, that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved.",http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001583,3,10191507,10191507,G,A,ENST00000256474.2,,,,,75,GRCh37,,,,,,
