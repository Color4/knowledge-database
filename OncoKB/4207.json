[{"evidenceId":19764,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"MEF2BNB-MEF2B (also known as BORCS8-MEF2B) is a gene that encodes for the transcription factor MEF2B, which has important function in normal tissue development (PMID: 26506234). MEF2B can recruit either activators or repressors to its target genes (PMID: 22955990, 12700764). MEF2B target genes include known oncogenes such as MYC (PMID: 22955990, 12700764). T-cell receptor mediated apoptosis is mediated by MEF2B (PMID: 10531067). MEF2B mutations have been observed in various lymphomas (PMID: 21796119, 22343534).
