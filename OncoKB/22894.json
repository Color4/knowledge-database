[{"evidenceId":17680,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The DIS3 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome complex, prominently participating in RNA processing and quality control pathways. DIS3 catalytic activity is governed by the endoribonucleolytic (PIN) and the 3’–5’ exoribonucleolyitic (RNB) domains (PMID: 21289487). DIS3 affects the RNA-processing machinery and genetic alterations of DIS3, such as copy number gains and increased mRNA expression, were recently described in colorectal cancer (PMID: 23319804, 24478024). Additionally, a recent study in melanoma cell lines showed that overexpression and increased DNA copy number in the region of DIS3 may play a role in the aggressive phenotype of nodular melanoma cells (PMID: 21343389). In contrast, loss-off-function mutations in the DIS3 gene have been described in multiple myeloma (MM), suggesting a possible mechanism to disrupt protein translation (PMID: 21430775). Recently, the DIS3 gene has emerged as recurrently mutated in patients with MM from initial whole-genome (WGS) and exome (WES) sequencing studies (PMID: 21430775, 24434212, 22573403, 25521164, 23396385, 22237025). Some DIS3 mutations identified in MM were shown to interfere with its exonucleolytic activity, causing aberrant RNA metabolism and slower proliferation rates in cell lines (PMID: 24150935). Furthermore, DIS3 facilitates the maturation of the tumor suppressor let-7 miRNAs by reducing the stability of LIN28B, an inhibitor of let-7 processing. Through the reduction of mature let-7, DIS3 enhances the translation of let-7 targets such as MYC and RAS, leading to enhanced tumorigenesis (PMID: 25925570). Next-generation sequencing analysis of the DIS3 PIN and RNB domains in purified bone marrow plasma cell (PC) dyscrasia from 164 representative patients, including 130 cases with MM, 24 with primary PC leukemia and 10 with secondary PC leukemia) found DIS3 mutations respectively in 18.5%, 25% and 30% of cases (PMID: 26305418). Gene expression profiling analysis in DIS3-mutated patients identified a transcriptional signature suggestive for impaired RNA exosome function, raising the possibility that DIS3 represents a potential tumor suppressor gene in such disorders (PMID: 26305418).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":22894,"hugoSymbol":"DIS3","name":"DIS3 homolog, exosome endoribonuclease and 3'-5' exoribonuclease","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000377767","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014953.3","geneAliases":["KIAA1008","EXOSC11","2810028N01Rik","dis3p","RRP44"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21343389","title":"Integrative genomics identifies molecular alterations that challenge the linear model of melanoma progression.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2011 Apr 1","volume":"71","issue":"7","pages":"2561-71","authors":"Rose AE et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2958","link":null,"reference":"Rose AE et al.
