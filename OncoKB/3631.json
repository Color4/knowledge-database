The primary function of INPP4A is to selectively hydrolyze the position 4 phosphate group on the inositol ring, converting PI(3,4)P2 to PI(3)P (PMID: 24069021). INPP4A is predominantly expressed in the brain and maintains the integrity of the brain by regulating excitotoxic neuronal death. (PMID 20463662). INPP4A has been implicated in the suppression of cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice via downregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (PMID: 21127264, 19325558). Recent studies have shown co-mutations with BAP1 and INPP4A in patients with mesothelioma and asbestos-exposed lung adenocarcinoma (PMID 26463840).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3631,"hugoSymbol":"INPP4A","name":"inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type I A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000074304","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001134224.1","geneAliases":["INPP4","TVAS1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19325558","title":"Regulation of PI(3)K/Akt signalling and cellular transformation by inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase-1.","journal":"EMBO reports","pubDate":"2009 May","volume":"10","issue":"5","pages":"487-93","authors":"Ivetac I et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/embor.2009.28","link":null,"reference":"Ivetac I et al.
