Mouse models of NPM1 loss demonstrate a role in regulating hematopoietic development and genomic stability (PMID: 16007073). It regulates nucleolar structure, DNA damage response and repair, and ribosome biogenesis (PMID: 18729828, 18809582, 24648491). The P53 tumor suppressor pathway, specifically interactions with HDM2 and ARF, is affected by NPM1 activity (PMID: 15144954,15684379). Mutations in NPM1 that result in a cytoplasmic form, NPM1c, are found in acute myeloid leukemia and can be associated with a more favorable prognosis (PMID: 15659725).
