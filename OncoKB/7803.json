[{"evidenceId":18977,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The PTP4A1 gene encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) with a characteristic PTP domain that is necessary to dephosphorylate its substrates, and a prenylation domain that allows the protein to bind the plasma membrane (PMID: 9018080, 15571731). PRP4A1 forms part of the mitotic spindle and stimulates progression from G1 to S phases during mitosis, probably via negative regulation of the p21 tumor suppressor (PMID: 12235145, 14643450). PTP4A1 enhances cell migration, invasion and metastasis by activating SRC and ERK pathways (PMID: 12782572, 19199380, 2241399). THE PTP4A1 gene is rarely altered in human tumors, only being amplified in a small subset of tumors such as prostate cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7803,"hugoSymbol":"PTP4A1","name":"protein tyrosine phosphatase type IVA, member 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000370651","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003463.4","geneAliases":["PRL1","PRL-1","HH72","PTPCAAX1","PTP(CAAX1)"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"2241399","title":"[American trypanosomiasis and chronic Chagas cardiopathy at the \"Ignacio Chaves\" National Institute of Cardiology].","journal":"Archivos del Instituto de Cardiologia de Mexico","pubDate":"1990 May-Jun","volume":"60","issue":"3","pages":"261-6","authors":"Gloss G et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Gloss G et al.
