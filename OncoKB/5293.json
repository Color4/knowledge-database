[{"evidenceId":3306,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PIK3CD, also known as p110-ẟ, is a catalytic subunit of PI3K that is important in creating phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which acts as a secondary messenger in key cellular signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR. PIK3CD primarily functions in immune cells through AKT signaling. It is required for T-cell receptor activation (PMID: 12130661), and it is also necessary for a full antibody response in B-cells (PMID: 12235209). Germline mutations in PIK3CD likely causes both immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative disease as a result of hyperactivation of AKT-mTOR signaling, which forces the differentiation of naive CD8+ T-cells into short-lived effector cells and reduces long-term memory T- and B-cells (PMID: 24165795). Idelalisib, a specific inhibitor of PIK3CD, has been used with Rituximab (a CD20 antibody) in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and has been associated with significant increase in progression-free survival (PMID: 24450857).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5293,"hugoSymbol":"PIK3CD","name":"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000377346","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005026.3","geneAliases":["APDS","PI3K","p110D","IMD14","P110DELTA"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24165795","title":"Dominant-activating germline mutations in the gene encoding the PI(3)K catalytic subunit p110δ result in T cell senescence and human immunodeficiency.","journal":"Nature immunology","pubDate":"2014 Jan","volume":"15","issue":"1","pages":"88-97","authors":"Lucas CL et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ni.2771","link":null,"reference":"Lucas CL et al.
