NKX2-1 expression has been found in a variety of tumor types, particularly in lung and thyroid cancers, in which the distribution is similar to that in normal tissues. In lung, NKX2-1 is expressed in around 70% of adenocarcinomas and 90% of small cell carcinomas, whereas it was not found or found at very low frequency in squamous carcinomas and large cell carcinomas. NKX2-1 has recently emerged as a useful molecular marker for lung cancer diagnosis (PMID: 23125078). In thyroid carcinomas NKX2-1 is primarily expressed in the follicular neoplasm and papillary carcinoma but not in anaplastic carcinoma (PMID: 12023581). In lung adenocarcinoma, sustained expression of NKX2-1 is frequently associated with gene amplification (PMID: 17925434, 18212743, 17616654, 17982442). A germline missense mutation of NKX2-1 that results in a valine substitution for alanine at codon 339 (A339V) has been identified in families affected by multinodular goiter and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PMID: 19176457). Rearrangements of NKX2-1 with T cell receptor or immunoglobulin heavy chain loci were also recently identified in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 21481790). Several lines of evidence suggest possible oncogenic involvement of NKX2-1 in other cancer types, such as gastrointestinal, genitourinary and neuroectodermal origin (glioblastoma and ependimoma) neoplasms (atlasgeneticoncology.com; 06/19/15). NKX2-1 appears to function as a double-edge sword in cancer pathogenesis. Despite its evident role as a an oncogene in lung adenocarcinomas, NKX2-1 expression is also associated with favorable prognosis, reducing invasion and metastasis in affected patients (PMID: 21471965).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7080,"hugoSymbol":"NKX2-1","name":"NK2 homeobox 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000354822","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001079668.2","geneAliases":["NKX2A","BCH","NK-2","TEBP","TITF1","NKX2.1","BHC","NMTC1","TTF-1","T/EBP"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12023581","title":"TTF-1 expression in pulmonary adenocarcinomas.","journal":"The American journal of surgical pathology","pubDate":"2002 Jun","volume":"26","issue":"6","pages":"767-73","authors":"Yatabe Y et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Yatabe Y et al.
