[{"evidenceId":5769,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"BAP1 (BRCA-associated Protein-1) is a nuclear ubiquitin hydrolase that has been implicated in several cellular processes including cell proliferation, DNA repair, chromatin regulation of gene expression, and stem cell pluripotency (PMID: 19815555, 20805357, 18757409). By deubiquitinating host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), a chromatin-associated protein that helps regulate transcription, BAP1 regulates cell proliferation (PMID: 19815555). BAP1 has been shown to regulate gene expression by forming a ternary complex with HCF-1 and the YY1 transcription factor (PMID: 20805357) and to enhance cell death by increasing progression through the G1-S checkpoint (PMID: 18757409). BAP1 loss alters class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression, which may result in altered therapeutic response to HDAC inhibitors in BAP1-depleted cancer cells (PMID: 25970771). Germline mutations of BAP1 predispose to several tumors including renal cell carcinoma, uveal melanoma and mesothelioma, which suggests that BAP1 is a tumor suppressor (PMID:23277170, 21874000, 23849051). Somatic BAP1 mutations are also common in these tumor types, among others (PMID: 23867514, 21642991, 23277170).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8314,"hugoSymbol":"BAP1","name":"BRCA1 associated protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000460680","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004656.3","geneAliases":["HUCEP-13","hucep-6"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"19815555","title":"The deubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 regulates cell growth via interaction with HCF-1.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"2009 Dec 4","volume":"284","issue":"49","pages":"34179-88","authors":"Machida YJ et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.046755","link":null,"reference":"Machida YJ et al.
