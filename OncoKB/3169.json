[{"evidenceId":12183,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The FOXA1 gene encodes the Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), a member of the Forkhead (FKHD) domain containing family of transcription factors (PMID: 19274050). The FOXA1 protein is comprised of two transactivating domains, one at the N-terminus and one at the C-terminus, as well as a central FKHD domain (PMID: 16909212). The FKHD domain confers the ability to bind to genomic DNA containing conserved FKHD sites (PMID: 8332212), and the C-terminal transactivating domain interacts with core histones H3/H4, which facilitates the “pioneering activity” of FOXA1 by opening and relaxing regions of condensed chromatin upon FOXA1 binding (PMID: 16909212); this allows for the recruitment of other transcription factors, including androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) (PMID: 21934649). FOXA1 is normally expressed in a number of tissue types, including lung, liver, pancreas, colon, bladder, prostate and breast (PMID: 22115363). It is required for normal prostate development and maturation, prostate specific gene expression and cellular differentiation through its direct interaction with AR and modulation of the AR cistrome and AR signaling (PMID: 15987773, 21934649, 22649425, 18358809). Luminal-specific deletion of FOXA1 in the mouse prostate results in high rates of epithelial cell proliferation and increased expression of basal cell markers (PMID: 24840332), indicating that FOXA1 may play a role in promoting and maintaining epithelial cell differentiation. FOXA1 is also required for normal mammary ductal morphogenesis and expression of ER-alpha, however, it is not necessary for the development of the alveolar lineage (PMID: 20501593). FOXA1 has emerged as one of the most frequent recurrently mutated genes in primary and metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recurrent FOXA1 mutations are observed in prostate and breast cancer, the majority of which map to the DNA-binding FKHD domain (PMID: 25470049, 23000897,22495314; cBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2015). FOXA1 is also frequently mutated in urothelial bladder carcinoma (PMID: 24476821) and amplified in a number of other tumor types as well (cBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2015).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3169,"hugoSymbol":"FOXA1","name":"forkhead box A1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000250448","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004496.3","geneAliases":["HNF3A","TCF3A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22495314","title":"The clonal and mutational evolution spectrum of primary triple-negative breast cancers.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2012 Apr 4","volume":"486","issue":"7403","pages":"395-9","authors":"Shah SP et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature10933","link":null,"reference":"Shah SP et al.
