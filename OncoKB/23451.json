SF3B1 is an essential gene/protein so loss is not tolerated in cells, therefore very few if any truncating mutations or SF3B1 gene loss/deletions are observed. This complex contains snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs), snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles) and non-snRNP proteins. SF3B1 binds to nucleosomes to identify exon and intron junctions of coding genes (PMID: 25892229). SF3B1 also contributes to sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation (PMID: 25257310). Mutations in SF3B1 are recurrent in uveal melanoma (PMID: 26842708). Additionally, mutations in SF3B1 are frequent in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (PMID: 21909114, 21995386), especially those with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (PMID: 21995386, 21998214). Mutations in SF3B1 lead to altered gene expression and aberrant alternative splicing (PMID: 25428262). mRNAs can become mis-spliced by use of alternative or non-canonical splice sites or may retain introns leading to altered coding sequences (PMID: 25768983, 22150006). Mutations in SF3B1 tend to occur in the C-terminal HEAT repeat region and tend to be missense mutations rather than non-sense or frameshift mutations, suggesting that either gain-of-function, dominant negative or altered function results rather than complete loss of function (PMID: 22150006, 21909114). Mutations in SF3B1 are often mutually exclusive with mutations in other splicing factor mutations, including SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, SF1, PRPF40B, U2AF2 and SF3A1 (PMID: 21909114). The SF3B complex can be inhibited by naturally occurring compounds, including spliceostatin A (PMID: 17643111), meayamycin B (PMID: 23485022) and pladienolide (PMID: 17643112).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-05","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":23451,"hugoSymbol":"SF3B1","name":"splicing factor 3b subunit 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000335508","curatedRefSeq":"NM_012433.2","geneAliases":["PRP10","SAP155","Hsh155","PRPF10","SF3b155","MDS"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25768983","title":"Transcriptome sequencing reveals potential mechanism of cryptic 3' splice site selection in SF3B1-mutated cancers.","journal":"PLoS computational biology","pubDate":"2015 Mar","volume":"11","issue":"3","pages":"e1004105","authors":"DeBoever C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004105","link":null,"reference":"DeBoever C et al.
