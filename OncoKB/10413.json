[{"evidenceId":2414,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The YAP1 gene (Yes associated protein 1) encodes for YAP protein, a transcriptional co-activator and downstream effector of the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway is involved in several processes of cancer progression and physiologically has important regulatory functions in organ development and regeneration (PMID: 23467301, 24825474, 24336504). YAP largely mediates the downstream effects of Hippo signaling (PMID: 20951342); it shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and functions as transcriptional co‑activator. In the nucleus YAP induces expression of proliferative and anti-apoptotic genes via interactions with transcription factors, and in particular the TEA domain family members (TEAD) (PMID: 20951342). When the inhibitory Hippo pathway is ‘on’, LATS1 and LATS2 kinases phosphorylate and inactivate YAP. In contrast, when the Hippo pathway is ‘off ’, unphosphorylated YAP translocates into the nucleus and induces target gene expression (e.g. AMOTL2, AREG ,BIRC5, CTGF, CYR61) (PMID: 24336504). Recent data suggests that YAP can also induce microRNA (miRNA) repression in a TEAD-independent manner, which has been proposed to promote tumorigenesis (PMID: 24581491). Hyperactivation of YAP is widespread in cancers and reports of gene amplification and epigenetic activation in cancer support the role of YAP as a classic oncogene (PMID: 25592648, 24336504). The effect of hyperactivation/high expression of YAP is believed to involve contact-inhibition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastatic potential and stem-cell phenotype (PMID: 17974916, 24336504, 25702974). Although YAP behaves as an oncogene in several cancers, recent data suggest that YAP can also act as a tumor suppressor in certain cellular contexts (PMID: 24976009, 22234184).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10413,"hugoSymbol":"YAP1","name":"Yes associated protein 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000282441","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001130145.2","geneAliases":["YAP2","YAP65","COB1","YKI","YAP"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23467301","title":"The Hippo pathway and human cancer.","journal":"Nature reviews.
