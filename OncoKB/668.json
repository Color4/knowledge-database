FOXL2 encodes the nuclear protein FOXL2, which is strongly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells, and is essential for ovarian development and function (PMID: 24817949); it is also expressed in the pituitary gland and periocular region. Through interaction with other transcription factors and tumor suppressors, FOXL2 regulates several cell processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle progression and cell adhesion (PMID: 19747961). As a potential tumor suppressor, it has been shown to inhibit cervical squamous cancer cell proliferation and invasion, while promoting apoptosis (PMID: 24817949). Reduced expression of FOXL2 has also been noted in a majority of juvenile ovarian granulosa cell tumors; the C134W mutation of this gene has been identified in adult granulosa cell tumors. The precise role of FOXL2 overexpression, both of the wildtype and the C134W mutant, have yet to be fully elucidated (PMID: 23372819, 23029457).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":668,"hugoSymbol":"FOXL2","name":"forkhead box L2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000330315","curatedRefSeq":"NM_023067.3","geneAliases":["BPES1","BPES","PINTO","POF3","PFRK"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23372819","title":"Overexpression of wild-type but not C134W mutant FOXL2 enhances GnRH-induced cell apoptosis by increasing GnRH receptor expression in human granulosa cell tumors.","journal":"PloS one","pubDate":"2013","volume":"8","issue":"1","pages":"e55099","authors":"Cheng JC et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0055099","link":null,"reference":"Cheng JC et al.
