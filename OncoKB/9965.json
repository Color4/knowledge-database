[{"evidenceId":19517,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family comprises 22 structurally related polypeptides that play crucial roles in neuronal functions, development, and metabolism. FGFs are classified as intracrine, paracrine, and endocrine FGFs based on their action mechanisms (PMID: 25772309). FGF19 is an endocrine FGF which require α-Klotho or β-Klotho as a cofactor for FGFRs. FGF19 activates FGFR4 with β-Klotho and exhibits metabolic and proliferative activities (PMID: 20018895, 26483756). FGF19 acts as a biomarker for Renal failure, coronary artery disease, intestinal failure-associated liver disease, diabetes, Crohn’s disease, and prostate cancer (PMID: 20013647, 24179013, 23940810, 25595885, 25664662, 23981126, 25518063, 25360305, 25854696).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9965,"hugoSymbol":"FGF19","name":"fibroblast growth factor 19","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000294312","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005117.2","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23981126","title":"Fibroblast growth factor 19 in patients with bile acid diarrhoea: a prospective comparison of FGF19 serum assay and SeHCAT retention.","journal":"Alimentary pharmacology &amp; therapeutics","pubDate":"2013 Oct","volume":"38","issue":"8","pages":"967-76","authors":"Pattni SS et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1111/apt.12466","link":null,"reference":"Pattni SS et al.
