[{"evidenceId":19700,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MAX (Myc-associated factor X) gene encodes a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family (PMID: 8479534, 2006410). MAX functions at the center of a transcription factor network that governs many aspects of cell behavior, inducing cell proliferation by binding to enhancer-boxes containing the CANNTG sequence (PMID: 16908182, 1557420). MAX lacks a transactivation domain, and thus MAX homodimers act as transcriptional repressors (PMID: 9824157). However, MAX also dimerizes with other bHLHZs such as MYC, MAD or MXL1 (PMID: 12553908). Heterodimers of MYC/MAX can bind and transactivate gene expression and promote cell proliferation and apoptosis. MAX is expressed in different splice-isoforms, each having different functions (PMID: 10229200, 1566084, 8426752). A \"delta MAX\" isoform, truncated at its C-terminus, appears to enhance MYC-driven tumorigenesis, whereas full-length MAX suppresses MYC-driven tumorigenesis (PMID: 1566084). Chromosomal rearrangements involving the MAX gene location at 14q22-q24 are common in several malignancies such as malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and uterine leiomyomas (PMID:1594250). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the MAX gene are found in patients with hereditary pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas (PMID: 21685915, 22452945). Other studies, however, were not able to reproduce these findings in a separate cohort (PMID: 23743562). MAX is recurrently inactivated through somatic mutations in 6% of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) (PMID: 24362264).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4149,"hugoSymbol":"MAX","name":"MYC associated factor X","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000358664","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002382.4","geneAliases":["bHLHd4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23743562","title":"MAX mutations status in Swedish patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma tumours.","journal":"Familial cancer","pubDate":"2014 Mar","volume":"13","issue":"1","pages":"121-5","authors":"Crona J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1007/s10689-013-9666-3","link":null,"reference":"Crona J et al.
