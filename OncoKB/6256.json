RXRA functions either as a homodimer or as a heterodimeric partner for a number of nuclear receptors. RXRA/PPARA (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor- alpha) heterodimers regulate PPARA-mediated transcriptional activity on genes involved with fatty acid oxidation, such as the cytochrome P450 system genes (PMID: 10195690). RXRA also heterodimerizes with the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R), Vitamin D3 receptor (VD3R) and Retinoic Acid Receptors (RARs). RXRA is required for forming stable complexes of these receptors with their cognate DNA response elements and for transactivation of genes regulating growth, differentiation, metabolism, homeostasis and neoplasia (PMID: 1314167, 1310351). RXRA deficiency causes hyperplasia and aberrant differentiation of skin epidermis and prostate epithelium (PMID: 11171393, 12183441).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6256,"hugoSymbol":"RXRA","name":"retinoid X receptor alpha","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000481739","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002957.4","geneAliases":["NR2B1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12183441","title":"Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in mice with conditional disruption of the retinoid X receptor alpha allele in the prostate epithelium.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2002 Aug 15","volume":"62","issue":"16","pages":"4812-9","authors":"Huang J et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Huang J et al.
