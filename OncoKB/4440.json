In mammals, the Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins is known to be important for cell fate determination, neural development, and maintenance of stem-cell state, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Musashi-1 protein is selectively expressed in neural progenitor cells, including neural stem cells (PMID: 9790759). Musashi-1protein, in co-operation with Musashi-2, activates Notch signaling through translational repression of mNumb mRNA, an intracellular Notch signal repressor, and maintains the self-renewingability of neural stem cells (NSCs) (PMID: 15925591). Musashi-1-mediated activation of the Wnt pathway also serves to sustain mammary gland stem cell pools (PMID: 18362162). In addition, Musashi-1 is aselective marker for intestinal stem or early lineage cells (PMID: 12924647, 15925591). Elevated Musashi-1 expression is present in gliomas and glioblastomas, and correlates with the malignancy and proliferativeactivity of the tumor (PMID: 11284014, 11896183).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4440,"hugoSymbol":"MSI1","name":"musashi RNA binding protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000257552","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002442.3","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11284014","title":"Expression of the neural RNA-binding protein Musashi1 in human gliomas.","journal":"Glia","pubDate":"2001 Apr 1","volume":"34","issue":"1","pages":"1-7","authors":"Toda M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Toda M et al.
