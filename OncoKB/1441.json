[{"evidenceId":19756,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CSF3R (Colony stimulating factor 3 receptor) encodes for a transmembrane receptor for cytokine colon stimulating factor 3; it also known as the G-CSF (Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) Receptor. Activation of the receptor is associated with the increased production of neutrophilic granulocytes and has been used clinically to shorten recovery time for chemotherapy and to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells into the periphery for stem cell collection (PMID:7521686, 3311216, 7534140). Signaling from the receptor is mediated by JAK (Janus kinase) and SRC (SRC proto-oncogene) family of kinases with downstream activation of STAT, PI3K, and MAPK signaling cascades (PMID:7579336, 9590246) and inhibition mediated through the SOCS (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling) proteins and tyrosine phosphatases (PMID:12133942, 9590246). Loss of function mutations can lead to severe congenital neutropenia (PMID:10449521, 24753537). Activating mutations can cause receptor dimerization independent of ligand with mutations near the juxtamembrane region or truncate the receptor leading to altered signal transduction (PMID:23739288, 8246993). These mutations have been found in myeloid disorders such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 7542747, 23656643). Solid tumors have been shown to express CSF3R that may be important for disease phenotype or transformation (PMID:16912178, 25908586)","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1441,"hugoSymbol":"CSF3R","name":"colony stimulating factor 3 receptor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000361632","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000760.3","geneAliases":["GCSFR","CD114"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"7521686","title":"Mice lacking granulocyte colony-stimulating factor have chronic neutropenia, granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cell deficiency, and impaired neutrophil mobilization.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"1994 Sep 15","volume":"84","issue":"6","pages":"1737-46","authors":"Lieschke GJ et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lieschke GJ et al.
