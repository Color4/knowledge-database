[{"evidenceId":19309,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"GSK3B encodes glycogen synthase kinase 3b, a multifunctional serine /threonine kinase found in all eukaryotes. The protein kinase functions as an important regulator of cellular signaling pathways involved in metabolism, cell cycle and proliferation (PMID: 24931005). Unlike most protein kinases, GSK3β is constitutively active in resting cells and undergoes a rapid and transient inhibition in response to a number of external signals. GSK3β activity is regulated by site-specific phosphorylation. Several kinases are capable of regulating the protein kinase including p70 S6 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p90Rsk, protein kinases A, B and C, and MEK1/2 (PMID: 12615961, 11527574, 16935409, 11394906, 15020233). Dysregulated GSK3B has been implicated in the development of a number of human diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases and bipolar disorder (PMID: 12615961, 11527574, 16935409). Overexpression of the protein kinase has also been implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression including ovarian, colon, liver and pancreatic carcinomas (PMID: 16556076, 17912008, 11883528, 16556076, 16342409, 18606491). Several GSK3β inhibitors have been studied in preclinical trials, for example pharmacological inhibitors suppress proliferation of the ovarian cancer cells in vitro and prevents the formation of tumors in nude mice generated by the inoculation of human ovarian cancer cells (PMID: 16788573).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2932,"hugoSymbol":"GSK3B","name":"glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000316626","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002093.3","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16788573","title":"Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta positively regulates the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells.","journal":"Cell research","pubDate":"2006 Jul","volume":"16","issue":"7","pages":"671-7","authors":"Cao Q et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Cao Q et al.
