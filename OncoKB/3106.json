[{"evidenceId":19159,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The HLA-B gene encodes human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I. This protein is involved in the presentation of foreign antigens to the immune system. HLA-B is anchored in the membrane of most cells, and it has a highly polymorphic region that facilitates a wide binding specificity for a variety of antigens that need to be presented to cytotoxic immune T cells (PMID: 25493333). Germline polymorphisms and haplotypes in HLA-B have been linked with various autoimmune syndromes and hypersensitivity to certain medications (PMID: 22188278, 25877443). Somatic mutations in HLA-B are rare events in human cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3106,"hugoSymbol":"HLA-B","name":"major histocompatibility complex, class I, B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000412585","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005514.6","geneAliases":["HEL-S-83","SPDA1","HLA-B39","B-4901","Bw-47","HLAB","HLA-B55","HLA-B-3905","Bw-50","HLA-B*45ZJ","HLA-B-3506","HLA-B15","HLA-B59","HLA-B-5502","HLA-B49","HLA-B-5602","HLA-Cw","AS","B-5001","HLA-B50","HLA-B61"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25493333","title":"T cell antigen receptor recognition of antigen-presenting molecules.","journal":"Annual review of immunology","pubDate":"2015","volume":"33","issue":"","pages":"169-200","authors":"Rossjohn J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1146/annurev-immunol-032414-112334","link":null,"reference":"Rossjohn J et al.
