It is a component of the E3 ligase complex for NEDD8 modification (neddylation) of substrates, an ubiquitin-like modification (PMID:18826954). Its activity is associated with regulating and activating von Hippel-Lindau E3 ligase and other cullin ubiquitin ligases (PMID:26743088, 23201271, 23401859). It is expressed in non-small cell lung carcinoma and may be associated with a poorer prognosis (PMID:22500162). DCUN1D1 is amplified in squamous cell carcinomas (PMID:17018598, 23908357).
