[{"evidenceId":18617,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"NCOA3 encodes for the gene nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (also known as pCIP, SRC3). It interacts with nuclear hormone receptors to enhance transcription (PMID:23850489, 15383283). NCOA3 has histone acetyltransferase activity and can recruit other histone acetyltransferase enzymes to the complex (PMID:9296499, 9192892). It acts to regulate pluripotency in stem cells, mammary gland development, and response to TNF alpha (PMID: 10823921, 23019124, 15383283). It is expressed in various cancer cells and affects processes including cancer metabolism, anti-apoptosis, and cell growth (PMID:24584933, 23388826, 20663904). Its over-expression is associated with poor prognosis in various tumor types including gastric and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 25970779, 20064830). The gene has been found to be amplified in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer (PMID:9252329, 22371647).
