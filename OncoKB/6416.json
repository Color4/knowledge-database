[{"evidenceId":19521,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"MAP2K4 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4) encodes a dual specificity kinase that directly phosphorylates and activates JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAP kinase (PMID: 7716521). MAP2K4 itself is phosphorylated by one of several upstream MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK). The activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways occurs in response to a variety of environmental stressors, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, heat shock, ionizing radiation, as well also inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. The downstream effect is altered transcriptional activity of c-Jun, p53, ELK1, ATF2 and several other transcription factors involved in apoptosis, cell survival, growth and differentiation (PMID: 17496914,19629069). The function of MAP2K4 as a tumor suppressor in primary cancers is supported by multiple reports of inactivating mutations in several tumor cell lines and human cancers at a rate of ~5% (PMID: 9331070, 9622070, 17496914, 22522925). Loss of heterozygosity of the 17p chromosomal region, where MAP2K4 is located in close proximity to TP53, is observed at a much higher frequency in many cancers (PMID: 16721048, 16627982, 19603523). In addition, MAP2K4 has been found to act as a metastatic suppressor in metastatic prostate and ovarian cell lines (PMID: 10554023, 12438272). However, the role of MAP2K4 in tumorigenesis remains controversial and appears to be context-dependent, as there is evidence for MAP2K4 pro-oncogenic activity in breast, pancreatic, skin and lung tumors (PMID:15184866, 20610622,16115952,17057737), as well as pro-metastatic activity in prostate cancer and pancreatic cancers (PMID: 25019290,16740690).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6416,"hugoSymbol":"MAP2K4","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000353533","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003010.3","geneAliases":["MKK4","SAPKK1","SERK1","MEK4","JNKK","MAPKK4","PRKMK4","SKK1","JNKK1","SAPKK-1","SEK1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25019290","title":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) promotes human prostate cancer metastasis.","journal":"PloS one","pubDate":"2014","volume":"9","issue":"7","pages":"e102289","authors":"Pavese JM et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0102289","link":null,"reference":"Pavese JM et al.
