Specifically, PTPRD contains extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains thus constituting a receptor-like PTP with a role in cell-cell adhesion (PMID: 16557282, 22977525). Identified targets for dephosphorylation by PTPRD include STAT3 and AURKA (PMID: 19478061, 22305495). PTPRD is inactivated in a large number of glioblastomas and is mutated, deleted or promoter methylated in multiple other human cancers, ranging from neuroblastomas to endometrial, lung and colon cancers and has a putative tumor suppressor function (PMID: 25263441, 19478061).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5789,"hugoSymbol":"PTPRD","name":"protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000356435","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002839.3","geneAliases":["HPTP","RPTPDELTA","HPTPD","PTPD","HPTPDELTA"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16557282","title":"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases and cancer.","journal":"Nature reviews.
