DNAJB1 interacts with HSP70 and induces its ATPase activity, which stimulates the association between HSP70 and Hsc70-interacting protein (HIP) (PMID: 24309468). A seminal feature of DNAJB1 is the presence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) tumors. Numerous independent studies have confirmed the presence of the fusion gene in 80-100% of FLCs tumor samples (PMID: 25557953, 25698061, 25605237, 25122662, 24578576, 26489647). The fusion encodes a chimeric protein that couples a segment of DNAJB1, with the catalytic domain of protein kinase A (PKA) that retains kinase activity. Although analyses of a wider array of cancer types are required to more definitively establish the specificity of DNAJB1-PRKACA to FLCs, the current evidence suggests that DNAJB1-PRKACA may be a tissue biomarker for FLCs and if the chimeric protein is secreted into circulation, it may also serve as a plasma biomarker.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3337,"hugoSymbol":"DNAJB1","name":"DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000254322","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006145.1","geneAliases":["Hdj1","Sis1","HSPF1","Hsp40","RSPH16B"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22075554","title":"Hsp40 regulates the amount of keratin proteins via ubiquitin-proteasome             pathway in cultured human cells.","journal":"International journal of molecular medicine","pubDate":"2012 Feb","volume":"29","issue":"2","pages":"165-8","authors":"Yamazaki S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2011.826","link":null,"reference":"Yamazaki S et al.
