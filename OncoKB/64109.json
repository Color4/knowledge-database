[{"evidenceId":17742,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CRLF2 (cytokine receptor-like factor 2) gene encodes a type I cytokine receptor that signals through the pro-oncogenic JAK-STAT pathway, which regulates processes such as proliferation and development of the hematopoetic system (PMID: 20807819). In order to signal, CRLF2 heterodimerizes with the IL7RA (interleukin 7 receptor), thus forming the receptor for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine that mediates B-cell precursor proliferation and survival (PMID: 9916685). CRLF2 is expressed on T cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and basophils (PMID: 11418668). Its activation is linked to a Th2 response, can lead to eosinophilia, and is implicated in reactivity and airway remodeling for asthma, in atopic dermatitis, and in immunity against helminth infections (PMID: 24167583, 26288354, 21841801, 23024277 ). Rearrangement of the gene is seen in precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25207766, 22897847, 19838194). Rearranged receptor can signal through the JAK-STAT and PI3K-MTOR pathways and lead to transformation (PMID: 22685175, 19838194).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":64109,"hugoSymbol":"CRLF2","name":"cytokine receptor-like factor 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000381566","curatedRefSeq":"NM_022148.2","geneAliases":["TSLPR","CRL2","CRLF2Y"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9916685","title":"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin: a cytokine that promotes the development of IgM+ B cells in vitro and signals via a novel mechanism.","journal":"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","pubDate":"1999 Jan 15","volume":"162","issue":"2","pages":"677-83","authors":"Levin SD et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Levin SD et al.
