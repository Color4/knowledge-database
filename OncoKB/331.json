The IAP domain mediates anti-apoptotic activity by binding and inhibiting caspases and is blocked by SMAC protein binding (PMID:9230442, 11242052). XIAP also contains a RING domain that mediates ubiquitination through E3 ligase activity (PMID:15803136, 18708583). It regulates Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response, MAPK signaling, copper metabolism, and cellular differentiation (PMID: 24975362 , 24497535, 20154138, 19011619, 23928917). In cancer, XIAP can mediate resistance to therapy (PMID:23727860, 22491673, 11280739, 12384799). Gerrmline mutations are associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome characterized by lymphohystiocytosis, hypogammaglobulinaemia, lymphomas, and immune disorders (PMID: 17080092, 23973892). Inhibitors of XIAP are in development for cancer therapy by inducing an apoptosis response (PMID: 15353805, 14749124).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":331,"hugoSymbol":"XIAP","name":"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000355640","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001167.3","geneAliases":["MIHA","ILP1","API3","BIRC4","hIAP3","IAP-3","hIAP-3","XLP2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22491673","title":"Smac mimetic LBW242 sensitizes XIAP-overexpressing neuroblastoma cells for TNF-α-independent apoptosis.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2012 May 15","volume":"72","issue":"10","pages":"2645-56","authors":"Eschenburg G et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4072","link":null,"reference":"Eschenburg G et al.
