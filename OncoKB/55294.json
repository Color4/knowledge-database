[{"evidenceId":12772,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The FBXW7 gene encodes an F-box protein subunit involved in substrate recognition by an SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase complex. Upon substrate identification, this complex modifies the substrate such that it is targeted for protein degradation. Substrates of FBXW7 include the proteins c-MYC, mTOR (PMID: 18787170), NOTCH1, cyclin-E, and JUN, which are instrumental in the regulation of cell division, differentiation and growth, and which are often inappropriately activated in cancer. As most FBXW7 substrates are proto-oncogenes that are processed for degradation by the SCF complex, FBXW7 functions as a tumor suppressor. Inactivation of FBXW7 by mutation or copy number loss results in aberrant accumulation of oncoproteins, which subsequently contributes to malignant transformation (PMID: 18094723). Alternate splicing of FBXW7 results in three distinct protein isoforms (α, β, γ) each with differential localization (PMID: 22673505). Mutations in FBXW7 can negatively affect isoform-specific functions, dimerization of subunits, protein localization, SCF assembly or substrate recognition. Most mutations in FBXW7 are point mutations that disrupt substrate binding, while <10% are small deletions or insertions (PMID: 24853181, 17909001).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":55294,"hugoSymbol":"FBXW7","name":"F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000281708","curatedRefSeq":"NM_033632.3","geneAliases":["FBX30","hAgo","FBXW6","SEL-10","hCdc4","AGO","FBW6","SEL10","FBW7","CDC4"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"18094723","title":"FBW7 ubiquitin ligase: a tumour suppressor at the crossroads of cell division, growth and differentiation.","journal":"Nature reviews.
