[{"evidenceId":19563,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"KDM5A (also known as JARID1A) encodes for lysine demethylase 5A, a histone demethylase for histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) (PMID:17320161). KDM5A's plant homeodomain (PHD) recognizes unmethylated H3K4 to locate the enzyme to specific chromatin regions (PMID: 25686748). Through chromatin modification and transcriptional silencing, KDM5A regulates cellular differentiation and cooperates with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in controlling cell cycle progression (PMID:18722178, 15949438, 23093672, 23112189). It also affects cellular metabolism and circadian rhythms (PMID: 26314709, 21960634). In cancer KDM5A promotes tumor progression by targeting cell cycle and angiogenesis genes and enhancing treatment resistance (PMID:23722541, 24716659, 26566863, 20371346). It is amplified in breast and head and neck cancers (PMID:22937203, 24425785). It is translocated in leukemia with the NUP98 gene and alters HOX gene expression (PMID:16419055, 19430464).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-08","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5927,"hugoSymbol":"KDM5A","name":"lysine demethylase 5A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000399788","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001042603.1","geneAliases":["RBBP2","RBBP-2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24716659","title":"Critical role of histone demethylase RBP2 in human gastric cancer angiogenesis.","journal":"Molecular cancer","pubDate":"2014 Apr 9","volume":"13","issue":"","pages":"81","authors":"Li L et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-81","link":null,"reference":"Li L et al.
