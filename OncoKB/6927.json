[{"evidenceId":19430,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The HNF1A gene encodes the protein Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor-Î±. HNF1A, together with other hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF4A, HNF6) forms tissue-specific regulatory circuits and acts as master regulators of liver and pancreatic islet transcription (PMID:14988562). HNF1A-/- mice showed defects in hepatic function, renal Fanconi syndrome, type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 11279518). Heterozygous germline mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of Young or MODY3 (PMID: 8945470). Bi-allelic somatic inactivating mutations and deletions in HNF1A are seen in about 40-50% of hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) (PMID: 12355088). Two HNF1A mutations, W206 (DNA binding domain) and P291 (Trans-activation domain), have been found over represented across different studies (PMID: 16496320, 20393147, 12355088). Among them, W206 is unique to HCA while P291 is common to both HCA and MODY. In rare cases of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), HNF1A mutations were seen in combination with other genetic alterations (PMID: 12355088).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-14","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6927,"hugoSymbol":"HNF1A","name":"HNF1 homeobox A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000257555","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000545.5","geneAliases":["HNF1","IDDM20","TCF-1","HNF-1A","LFB1","TCF1","MODY3"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"14988562","title":"Control of pancreas and liver gene expression by HNF transcription factors.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2004 Feb 27","volume":"303","issue":"5662","pages":"1378-81","authors":"Odom DT et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Odom DT et al.
