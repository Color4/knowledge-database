The pathway is triggered by mitosis and differentiation factors as well as cytokines, resulting in MEK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of MAPK1, which induces its homodimerization and translocation to the nucleus where it phosphorylates its target proteins (PMID: 9604935, 9166761, 17496918). MAPK1 targets include cytoskeletal molecules, nucleoporins, but foremost kinases and transcription factors with central roles in cell proliferation and survival, including include RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) and MSK (mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases), MYC, c-FOS, ELK-1, ETS-1 and MITF (PMID: 25320010, 22569528). MAPK1 and its homolog, MAPK3 (ERK1), are highly redundant in function, ubiquitously and often simultaneously expressed and are essential for cell proliferation (PMID: 23482492, 21248139, 17496918). MAPK1 is mutated at low frequency in human tumors, but a recurrent mutation, E322K, is found in cervical and head and neck cancers and amplification is observed in ovarian cancer (PMID: 25631445, 21720365, 23820584). Inhibitors of MAPK1/3 are being explored as complementary and alternative options to RAF and MEK inhibition in cases of resistance or partial response (PMID: 25435214).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-06","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5594,"hugoSymbol":"MAPK1","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000215832","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002745.4","geneAliases":["PRKM1","PRKM2","p41mapk","ERT1","p41","p40","P42MAPK","ERK-2","ERK2","p38","p42-MAPK","MAPK2","ERK"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21248139","title":"Deletion of ERK1 and ERK2 in the CNS causes cortical abnormalities and neonatal lethality: Erk1 deficiency enhances the impairment of neurogenesis in Erk2-deficient mice.","journal":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","pubDate":"2011 Jan 19","volume":"31","issue":"3","pages":"1149-55","authors":"Satoh Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2243-10.2011","link":null,"reference":"Satoh Y et al.
