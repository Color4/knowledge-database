It does so by regulating the transcriptional expression of important genes for the production of neurotransmitters such as tyrosin hydroxylase (TH) and others (PMID: 10230790). PHOX2B mutations can lead to congenital central hypo-ventilation syndrome (CCHS) and Hirschprung's disease (PMID: 12640453, 12631670). Patients with PHOX2B mutant CCHS have a higher incidence of neuroblastoma and a subset of hereditary as well as sporadic neuroblastoma show PHOX2B mutations (PMID: 15516980, 10360575, 15024693).
