[{"evidenceId":13098,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The TSC1 gene encodes the tumor suppressor hamartin, a key regulator of the pro-oncogenic mTOR signaling pathway (PMID: 23485365, 20301399, 10205261). Identified as a one of the two causative genes in tuberous sclerosis, much of what is known about the function of TSC1 has followed from investigation of its role in the development of hamartomas, which are multiple benign (and occasionally malignant) growths that characterize the disorder (PMID: 23485365, 9242607). TSC1 acts as a scaffold to form a heteromeric complex with TBC1D7 and TSC2 (tuberin), which functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) and inhibits RHEB (PMID: 22795129, 24529379, 24714658). RHEB is a GTPase which functions as a small molecular switch, activating mTORC1 when bound to GTP (PMID: 24863881). The TSC complex associates with RHEB at the lysosomal membrane and is thought to be the main regulator of RHEB via its GAP activity, which results in conversion of the RHEB-bound GTP to GDP thereby preventing the ability of RHEB to activate mTORC1 (PMID: 24863881, 24529379, 14614311). Both TSC1 and TSC2 are also phosphorylated by several kinases (e.g., AKT, RSK1, ERK, AMPK, and GSK3) thus integrating multiple pathways before providing regulatory inhibition to the mTOR pathway (PMID: 16959574). The mTOR pathway is upregulated in many, if not most, cancer types. Due to the central role of the mTOR pathway in cellular growth and regulation of protein synthesis, TSC1 inactivating mutations which result in a constitutively active mTORC1 complex have been theorized to result in cancer \"addiction\" to the mTOR pathway, thus indicating sensitivity to mTOR-inhibiting agents (rapamycin analogs) (PMID: 22923433). In fact, mutation in any of the TSC complex members results in loss of ability to regulate RHEB via dissociation of the TSC complex, loss of GAP activity and/or inability to localize the TSC complex to the lysosomal membrane (PMID: 24529379). TSC1 mutations, which are mostly truncating, frequently occur in human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, renal clear cell carcinoma, melanoma, cancers of the uterus, bladder, and stomach, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with frequencies ranging from 1% to 10% (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2015).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7248,"hugoSymbol":"TSC1","name":"tuberous sclerosis 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000298552","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000368.4","geneAliases":["TSC","LAM"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22923433","title":"Genome sequencing identifies a basis for everolimus sensitivity.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2012 Oct 12","volume":"338","issue":"6104","pages":"221","authors":"Iyer G et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1126/science.1226344","link":null,"reference":"Iyer G et al.
