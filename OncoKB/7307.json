[{"evidenceId":13357,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"U2AF1 (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1) encodes the splicing factor subunit protein, U2AF35, which together with its binding partner, U2AF65, regulate removal of introns from pre-mRNAs to produce mature mRNAs that will be translated during protein synthesis (PMID:1388271). The U2AF1 protein is essential for constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing since it recruits the whole U2AF complex to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA intron that will be spliced (PMID: 8647433, 10617206, 10617208). Mutations in the U2AF1 gene have been found recurrently similarly in hematological malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (PMID:22389253) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (PMID: 22158538) or Chronic Myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (PMID: 22323480). Interestingly it has been proposed that mutations in RNA splicing genes are drivers of the transition from MDS to different sort of myeloid leukemias (PMID:24030381). Therefore, the U2AF1 protein has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target (PMID: 21909114, 22158538, 22323480, 25965570, 25326705). Importantly, it has been shown that mutations in the U2AF1 gene happen early in leukemia development as it has been shown in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) and can persist during disease progression (PMID:25550361).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-05","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7307,"hugoSymbol":"U2AF1","name":"U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000291552","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006758.2","geneAliases":["FP793","U2AFBP","RN","RNU2AF1","U2AF35"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8647433","title":"The splicing factor U2AF35 mediates critical protein-protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing.","journal":"Genes &amp; development","pubDate":"1996 Jun 1","volume":"10","issue":"11","pages":"1356-68","authors":"Zuo P et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Zuo P et al.
