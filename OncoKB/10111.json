[{"evidenceId":2794,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The RAD50 gene encodes a component of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex. The MRN complex is recruited to the site of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as part of the DNA damage response (DDR) and plays a pivotal role in the repair of damage via either the homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways (PMID: 2659437, 15309560). Within this complex RAD50 functions as a flexible and dynamic dimer and has ATPase activity. The structure of RAD50 is known in great detail; it contains a globular ATPase domain, a long anti-parallel folding coiled-coil domain and a Zn-hook domain that allows two RAD50 promoters to dimerize (PMID: 21458667, 21511873, 21441914, 12152085). Targeted mutations in these three domains have revealed their functions in maintaining genomic integrity (PMID: 12152085, 24493214, 21892167, 25601756, 24532689, 12208847). Multiple RAD50 molecules may bridge DNA and allow MRN localization to damaged chromatin (PMID: 25576492). If the break is repaired by HR, MRN binding activates a DDR signaling cascade via the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase and the RAD50 ATPase domain stimulates MRE11 nuclease activity, thus allowing the resection and subsequent repair of the breaks. Additionally, RAD50 has a direct function in bridging the ends of DNA that are to be repaired via NHEJ. As with numerous other DNA repairs genes, mutations in RAD50 increase tumor susceptibility, with mutations identified in cohorts of patients with breast cancer (PMID: 16385572, 24894818). Recent studies have found that numerous cancers including 11% and 8% of urothelial, gastric and colorectal tumors respectively bear mutations in an MRX complex member (PMID: 24934408, 18440592, 11196187).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10111,"hugoSymbol":"RAD50","name":"RAD50 double strand break repair protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000265335","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005732.3","geneAliases":["hRad50","RAD502","NBSLD"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24934408","title":"Synthetic lethality in ATM-deficient RAD50-mutant tumors underlies outlier response to cancer therapy.","journal":"Cancer discovery","pubDate":"2014 Sep","volume":"4","issue":"9","pages":"1014-21","authors":"Al-Ahmadie H et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-14-0380","link":null,"reference":"Al-Ahmadie H et al.
