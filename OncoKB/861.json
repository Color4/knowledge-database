[{"evidenceId":10236,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RUNX1, also known as AML1 or CBFA2, is a transcription factor that is a master regulator of hematopoietic differentiation. It interacts with a diverse subset of transcriptional complexes and can act as a transcriptional activator via recruitment of histone acetyltransferases or methyltransferases (PMID: 18695000, 22012064), or a repressor via recruitment of histone deacetylases or Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (PMID: 21059642, 22325351). Due to its important role in hematopoiesis, conditional deletion of RUNX1 in mice results in an expansion of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor population, and defective T- and B-lymphocyte development (PMID: 14966519). RUNX1 is highly regulated via alternative splicing, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation, which has important regulatory consequences in cancer (PMID: 19386523). RUNX1 is frequently translocated and altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and Familial platelet disorder with predisposition for acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML) (PMID: 17290219, 15156185, 21174539). Many translocations involving RUNX1 lack the activation domain, and have a leukemogenic effect by acting as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation (PMID: 15156182).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":861,"hugoSymbol":"RUNX1","name":"runt related transcription factor 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000300305","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001754.4","geneAliases":["AML1-EVI-1","CBF2alpha","CBFA2","EVI-1","PEBP2aB","AMLCR1","PEBP2alpha","AML1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"19386523","title":"Post-translational modifications of Runx1 regulate its activity in the cell.","journal":"Blood cells, molecules &amp; diseases","pubDate":"2009 Jul-Aug","volume":"43","issue":"1","pages":"30-4","authors":"Wang L et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.03.005","link":null,"reference":"Wang L et al.
