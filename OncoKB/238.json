[{"evidenceId":7243,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"ALK encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase in the insulin receptor family that plays an important role in nervous system development. In cancer, ALK gene fusions with a variety of translocation partners result in aberrant activation of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, including STAT3, MAPK and PI3K pathways (PMID: 24715763). Mutations and deletions in the ALK gene are less common than translocations. Cancer types with ALK alterations include non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (PMID: 24060861).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":238,"hugoSymbol":"ALK","name":"anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000389048","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004304.4","geneAliases":["NBLST3","CD246"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24715763","title":"ALK-driven tumors and targeted therapy: focus on crizotinib.","journal":"Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine","pubDate":"2014","volume":"7","issue":"","pages":"87-94","authors":"Murga-Zamalloa C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.2147/PGPM.S37504","link":null,"reference":"Murga-Zamalloa C et al.
