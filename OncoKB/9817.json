[{"evidenceId":4917,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The KEAP1 gene encodes a substrate adaptor protein for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is formed by the proteins CUL3 and RBX1, and targets NRF2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PMID:15572695). NRF2 (encoded by the gene NFE2L2) is a master transcriptional regulator of the cellular antioxidant response (PMID: 24142871, 21251164). Activation of NRF2 can provide a fitness advantage for cells by upregulating pathways for handling xenobiotic stress and detoxification (PMID: 21251164). The body of KEAP1 contains 3 domains, known as the (1) N-terminal Broad-complex,Tramtrack, Bric-a-brac (BTB) dimerization domain, (2) intervening region (IVR) domain, and (3) C-terminal Kelch-repeat domain (PMID:21251164). The BTB domain binds CUL3, and the Kelch-repeat domain binds NRF2 via homodimerization of KEAP1 (PMID:21251164). The IVR region contains critical cysteine residues whose thiol side chains are modified in response to oxidative stress. Modification of cysteine residues in the IVR disrupts binding of KEAP1 to NRF2 and CUL3, resulting in the release of NRF2 for transcriptional activation of target genes (PMID:12193649, PMID:14585973). Mutations in KEAP1 tend to occur throughout the body of the gene (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Apr. 2015), and are commonly thought to disrupt KEAP1-dependent regulation of NRF2. This disruption activates NRF2-dependent pathways, including those regulated in the oxidative stress response (PMID: 24142871).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-27","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9817,"hugoSymbol":"KEAP1","name":"kelch like ECH associated protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000171111","curatedRefSeq":"NM_203500.1","geneAliases":["INrf2","KLHL19"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"21251164","title":"Molecular mechanisms of the Keap1â€“Nrf2 pathway  in stress response and cancer evolution.","journal":"Genes to cells : devoted to molecular &amp; cellular mechanisms","pubDate":"2011 Feb","volume":"16","issue":"2","pages":"123-40","authors":"Taguchi K et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2010.01473.x","link":null,"reference":"Taguchi K et al.
