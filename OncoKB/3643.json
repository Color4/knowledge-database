Insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II are the natural ligands of INSR and their binding to INSR leads to receptor auto-phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of INSR targets (IRS1-4, SHC, GAB1, CBL) (PMID: 19274663). As a result of INSR signalling cells upregulate glucose uptake and proliferation as well as angiogenesis is increased (PMID: 25864925). High INSR pathway activation has oncogenic functions in several tumor entities (PMID: , 25821562, 25694511, 26406954). High INSR activity driven by IGF2 is a mechanism of chemoresistance in GATA2 high prostate cancer (PMID: 25670080). NSR activity seems required for the transformation by ETV6-NTRK3 in secretory breast cancer cells (PMID: 21148487). The INSR pathway seems required for the growth of hormone dependent breast cancer and targeted inhibition of INSR with small molecules has been shown to synergize with hormonal agents in estrogen dependent breast cancer (PMID: 22042792, 21908557).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3643,"hugoSymbol":"INSR","name":"insulin receptor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000302850","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000208.2","geneAliases":["CD220","HHF5"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26406954","title":"Quantification of insulin receptor mRNA splice variants as a diagnostic tumor marker in breast cancer.","journal":"Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers","pubDate":"2015","volume":"15","issue":"5","pages":"653-61","authors":"Aljada A et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3233/CBM-150505","link":null,"reference":"Aljada A et al.
