19201,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"The FAM58A gene encodes a protein with a cyclin-box-fold domain, which resembles those found in cell cycle regulator proteins known as cyclins. However, only recently the product of FAM58A gene has been characterized as the cyclin M protein (PMID: 24218572). Cyclin M interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 10 (CDK10) and induces degradation of transcription factor ETS2. Silencing or truncating mutations of FAM58A/cyclin M stabilizes ETS2 protein levels, increases c-RAF signaling and confers tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells (PMID: 24218572). Germline loss-of-function and deletions in FAM58A have been identified as the genetic cause of STAR syndrome, an X-linked hereditary condition characterized by toe syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations (PMID: 18297069). Mutations of FAM58A are rare events in human cancers, but one-third of them are truncating alterations (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016).",,2017-03-28,,92002,FAM58A,family with sequence similarity 58 member A,False,ENST00000406277,NM_152274.4,False,24218572,CDK10/cyclin M is a protein kinase that controls ETS2 degradation and is deficient in STAR syndrome.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2017-11-26T20:13:00,110,48,19525-30,Guen VJ et al,doi: 10.1073/pnas.1306814110,,0001-11-26,,18297069,"Mutations in the cyclin family member FAM58A cause an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations.",Nature genetics,2018-03-01T20:08:00,40,3,287-9,Unger S et al,doi: 10.1038/ng.86,,0001-03-01,
