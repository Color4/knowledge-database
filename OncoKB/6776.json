[{"evidenceId":18187,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A) is a transcription factor that is activated by cytokines and growth factors including interleukin 2,3, and 7 (IL2, IL3, IL7), Granulocyte Macrophage- colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and growth hormones (PMID:15313458, 9630227, 7744007). It is phosphorylated by Janus kinase (JAK) kinases, resulting in dimerization and nuclear translocation (PMID:25527793). STAT5A regulates development and differentiation of tissues and cells including the mammary gland, hepatocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, and B-cells and T-Cells (PMID:15711548, 9009201, 11290598, 18347089, 24497979). STAT5A activation is involved in tumor progression, resistance, and transformation in various tissues including prostate cancer and breast cancer (PMID:23675504, 18508994). In leukemias and myeloproliferative neoplasms, STAT5A signaling may be activated through mutations in the JAK proteins or the FLT3 receptor (PMID:17356133, 17379095, 22234689). Copy number alternation have been identified in breast cancer samples (PMID: 25470049).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6776,"hugoSymbol":"STAT5A","name":"signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000345506","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003152.3","geneAliases":["STAT5","MGF"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22234689","title":"Essential role for Stat5a/b in myeloproliferative neoplasms induced by BCR-ABL1 and JAK2(V617F) in mice.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2012 Apr 12","volume":"119","issue":"15","pages":"3550-60","authors":"Walz C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-397554","link":null,"reference":"Walz C et al.
