It is expressed in a tissue specific manner throughout human development (PMID: 9522457). The N-terminal domain of WT1 is involved in RNA and protein interactions (PMID: 9522457). This domain is critical for the transcriptional regulatory function of WT1. The C-terminal domain of WT1 is composed of four zinc fingers, which mediate binding to target DNA sequences. WT1 target genes include MYC and BCL2, which are important for cellular growth and metabolism (PMID: 7585606). WT1 physically interacts and stabalizes TP53 (PMID: 8389468). Due to alternative splicing, WT1 exists in several isoforms that exhibit either enhancing or repressive activity on target gene transcription (PMID: 7845666). WT1 was initially discovered as a tumor suppressor in Wilmsâ€™ tumor (WT), hence its name (PMID: 2163761; PMID: 9090524). However, most cases of Wilms' tumors express WT1 at normal or even high levels, suggesting that WT1 loss only contributes to the pathogenesis of a small fraction of Wilms' tumors (PMID: 16110318). In recent years, a potential role for WT1 as an oncogene was revealed. WT1 is overexpressed in a variety of human hematological and non-hematological cancers (PMID: 16547468). In leukemia there is growing evidence demonstrating WT1 importance in cell survival, differentiation and proliferation (PMID: 7808002, 7596170). Increased WT1 levels have prognostic significance and are associated with a poor response to therapy in AML (PMID: 16461320, 15084694). Recently, immunotherapeutic agents have been developed targeting WT1 in leukemia, which show promising anti-leukemic effects (PMID: 23486779, 26389576).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7490,"hugoSymbol":"WT1","name":"Wilms tumor 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000332351","curatedRefSeq":"NM_024426.4","geneAliases":["EWS-WT1","WT33","GUD","NPHS4","WIT-2","AWT1","WAGR"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12835718","title":"WT1 in acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome: therapeutic potential of WT1 targeted therapies.","journal":"Leukemia","pubDate":"2003 Jul","volume":"17","issue":"7","pages":"1301-12","authors":"Rosenfeld C et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Rosenfeld C et al.
