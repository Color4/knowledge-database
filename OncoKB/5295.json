In the absence of upstream receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation, p85α both stabilizes and inhibits the activity of p110α, the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Upon RTK activation, p85α binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of RTKs. Subsequently, this recruits the PI3K enzymatic complex to the cell membrane and allows the p110α catalytic subunit to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (PMID: 12040186, 1707345, 2833705). The production of PIP3 results in recruitment and activation of the serine/threonine kinase, AKT, which in turn activates numerous downstream targets (e.g. mTOR) involved in cell growth, proliferation and survival (PMID: 12094235). PIK3R1 mutations occur most frequently in its two SRC Homology 2 (SH2) domains, nSH2 and iSH2 (PMID: 21478295, 19962665). These mutations disrupt the ability of p85α to inhibit the PI3K catalytic subunit, thus resulting in aberrant activation of AKT-mTOR signaling (PMID: 9450999, 11606375, 15932879, 17626883, 18079394, 19962665,). Across all tumor types, PIK3R1 mutations tend to be mutually exclusive with alterations in TP53, PIK3CA, SETD2 and WT1 (PMID: 24132290). PIK3R1 mutations are prevalent in glioblastoma and to a lesser extent in endometrial, breast and colorectal cancers (PMID: 23636398, 24120142, 17932254, 22810696).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5295,"hugoSymbol":"PIK3R1","name":"phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000274335","curatedRefSeq":"NM_181523.2","geneAliases":["p85-ALPHA","GRB1","IMD36","p85","AGM7"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24132290","title":"Mutational landscape and significance across 12 major cancer types.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2013 Oct 17","volume":"502","issue":"7471","pages":"333-339","authors":"Kandoth C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature12634","link":null,"reference":"Kandoth C et al.
