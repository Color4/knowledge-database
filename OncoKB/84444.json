[{"evidenceId":19778,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"DOT1L encodes for DOT1-like histone H3K79 methyltransferase, methylating the histone 3 lysine 79 residue (PMID:12123582). H3K79 methylation is associated with DNA damage response to double stranded breaks (PMID:15525939). This modification has also been implicated in diverse cellular and developmental processes including cell division, embryonic development, meiosis, and hematopoiesis (PMID:21724828, 24526115). H3K79 methylation modifies chromatin structure and can promote active transcription (PMID:18285465). In leukemias, this modification promotes active transcription by preventing the binding of the inhibitory Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) complex (PMID:25822366). In Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) translocation leukemias, DOT1L was shown to be important for the transformation activity of the MLL fusion protein, and inhibitors of DOT1L have been employed in the treatment of this subset of leukemias (PMID:18977325, 15851025, 21741596). In breast cancer, DOT1L has been shown to cooperate with a c-Myc-p300 complex to promote epithelial to mesechymal transition and clinically be associated with more aggressive disease (PMID:26199140). Mutations in DOT1L have been identified in large-scale sequencing efforts of solid tumors including colon, small cell lung cancer, and squamous head and neck cancer (PMID:22810696, 26168399, 25056374).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":84444,"hugoSymbol":"DOT1L","name":"DOT1 like histone lysine methyltransferase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000398665","curatedRefSeq":"NM_032482.2","geneAliases":["KMT4","DOT1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26199140","title":"DOT1L cooperates with the c-Myc-p300 complex to epigenetically derepress CDH1 transcription factors in breast cancer progression.","journal":"Nature communications","pubDate":"2015 Jul 22","volume":"6","issue":"","pages":"7821","authors":"Cho MH et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ncomms8821","link":null,"reference":"Cho MH et al.
