Additionally, the presence of RING1 and RNF2 in the BCOR complex suggests BCOR involvement in the ubiquitylation of histones (PMID: 19738629). Germline mutations in BCOR are responsible for the inherited oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes (15004558). BCOR fusions have been shown to be recurrent in soft tissue and endometrial stromal sarcomas (PMIDs: 22387997, 25176412, 24805859, 25360585, 23580382, 24285434), as well as in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (PMID: 20807888). These fusions lead to oncogenesis by activating various anti-apoptotic pathways. Interestingly, BCOR has been identified as both the N-terminal and the C-terminal fusion partner depending on the type of cancer in which it is expressed, suggesting differing mechanisms for oncogenesis in these tumors (PMID: 25360585). BCOR truncating mutations have also been demonstrated to be recurrent in different types of hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (PMISs: 22012066, 24047651, 25550361), and in retinoblastoma (PMID: 22237022). BCOR is known to interact with the transcriptional repressor BCL6 and truncating mutations in BCOR leading to oncogenesis have demonstrated the gene to be an important tumor suppressor (PMID: 22012066).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":54880,"hugoSymbol":"BCOR","name":"BCL6 corepressor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000378444","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001123385.1","geneAliases":["MAA2","ANOP2","MCOPS2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22012066","title":"Whole-exome sequencing identifies somatic mutations of BCOR in acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2011 Dec 1","volume":"118","issue":"23","pages":"6153-63","authors":"Grossmann V et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-365320","link":null,"reference":"Grossmann V et al.
