IGF2 binds to one of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including IGF1R and Ir-A, to initiate a cascade that activates mitogenic and metabolic signaling via the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways (PMID: 24080445). In most adult tissues IGF2 is imprinted, and thus its expression is restricted to the paternal allele only (PMID: 12637750). Aberrant IGF2 expression, in many cases due to loss of imprinting, is implicated in the development of several tumor types (e.g. breast, ovarian, and Wilms tumors) (PMID: 17686827, 24080445), as well as the progression of tumors to more aggressive disease (e.g. breast cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia) (PMID: 20089431, 9558368, 24080445). Loss-of-imprinting of IGF2 is causative for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which confers an increased risk of developing childhood tumors such as Wilmsâ€™ tumor and hepatoblastoma (PMID: 8968759, 12668598, 23620526). Overexpression of IGF2 is also the critical event in non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (PMID: 24616774, 24080445).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3481,"hugoSymbol":"IGF2","name":"insulin like growth factor 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000434045","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001127598.1","geneAliases":["C11orf43","PP9974","GRDF","IGF-II"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17686827","title":"Epigenetic specificity of loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene in Wilms tumors.","journal":"Journal of the National Cancer Institute","pubDate":"2007 Aug 15","volume":"99","issue":"16","pages":"1270-3","authors":"Bjornsson HT et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Bjornsson HT et al.
