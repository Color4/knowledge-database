NTHL1 localizes in the nucleus, where it catalyzes the N-glycosylation of damaged DNA and subsequent cleavage of the resulting modified bond, constituting the first steps towards DNA repair in the base excision repair (BER) pathway (PMID: 10882850, 18166975, 21930793, 9890904, 17923696). Low NTHL1 expression has been associated with a decreased capacity for DNA repair in gastric cancer (PMID: 19414504). However, a dual role for NTHL1 has been described in irradiated cells; it both repairs potentially lethal DNA lesions and generates lethal double-strand breaks at radiation-induced sites (PMID: 16111924). NTHL1 interacts with PCNA and p53 proteins (PMID: 15358233). Germline truncating mutations of NTHL1 have been identified as the causal alteration in families with hereditary colorectal tumors and other neoplasias (PMID: 25938944, 26559593). Paradoxically, NTHL1 is somatically amplified in a subset of breast and pancreatic tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4913,"hugoSymbol":"NTHL1","name":"nth-like DNA glycosylase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000219066","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002528.5","geneAliases":["OCTS3","hNTH1","NTH1","FAP3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9890904","title":"Excision of products of oxidative DNA base damage by human NTH1 protein.","journal":"Biochemistry","pubDate":"1999 Jan 5","volume":"38","issue":"1","pages":"243-6","authors":"Dizdaroglu M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Dizdaroglu M et al.
