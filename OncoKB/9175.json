The JNK pathway, a MAP-kinase pathway, is activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and extracellular stresses (PMID: 11163770). It plays a role in cellular proliferation, apoptosis and morphogenesis (PMID: 9561845). Significant roles in this signaling cascade are played by MAPK (JNK), MAPKKs (MKK7 and SEK1/MKK4) and a variety of MAPKKKs, including MEKK1, ASK1, TAK1 and MLK family proteins (e.g. MAP3K13) (PMID: 11163770, 8637721). The MAP3K13 protein consists of a catalytic domain followed by a double leucine/isoleucine zipper. Through the leucine/isoleucine zipper domain, MAP3K13 forms dimers or oligomers with other proteins, such as JNK interacting protein (JIP-1), an interaction that is essential for the activation of MKK7 in the JNK signaling cascade (PMID: 9353328, 11163770, 11726227). MAP3K13 mRNA is found primarily in the pancreas, with lower levels of expression in the brain, liver and placenta (PMID: 9353328). Amplification and missense mutations of MAP3K13 are found in various solid tumors, including breast and lung cancer, and melanoma (PMID: 22722201, 22817889; cBioPortal, MSKCC, Oct. 2015).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9175,"hugoSymbol":"MAP3K13","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 13","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000265026","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004721.4","geneAliases":["LZK","MLK","MEKK13"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8637721","title":"Activation of the JNK pathway by distantly related protein kinases, MEKK and MUK.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"1996 Feb 1","volume":"12","issue":"3","pages":"641-50","authors":"Hirai S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Hirai S et al.
