[{"evidenceId":10192,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"EZH2 is the catalytic component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which is responsible for transcriptional repression by catalyzing di- and tri-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). EZH2 requires other members of the PRC2 complex for full methyltransferase activity, including SUZ12 and EED (PMID: 15225548, 15916951), and PRC2 function is important in repression of developmental regulators such as the HOX genes, and X-inactivation (PMID: 16618801, 12649488). Additionally, non-coding RNA's can guide EZH2 to genomic targets for gene repression (PMID: 17604720, 22659877). EZH2 overexpression is found in many malignancies including lymphoma, bladder cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer, and is associated with advanced stage and poor prognosis (PMID: 11389032, 16361539, 12374981, 14500907, 16330673, 24097870). Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in EZH2 occur frequently in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (PMID: 20081860, 21190999). EZH2 can also act as a tumor suppressor in certain cancer types, and recurrent inactivating mutations are observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (PMID: 20601953). Given its importance in multiple cancer types, EZH2 inhibition has shown promise in pre-clinical studies and is a current effort in multiple clinical trials, either through direct inhibition of EZH2 enzymatic activity or through disruption in PRC2 stability (PMID: 26845405).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2146,"hugoSymbol":"EZH2","name":"enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000320356","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004456.4","geneAliases":["ENX-1","ENX1","EZH2b","WVS","WVS2","KMT6","KMT6A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11389032","title":"Coexpression of BMI-1 and EZH2 polycomb-group proteins is associated with cycling cells and degree of malignancy in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2001 Jun 15","volume":"97","issue":"12","pages":"3896-901","authors":"van Kemenade FJ et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"van Kemenade FJ et al.
