[{"evidenceId":18900,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PPP4R2 encodes a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4C), a protein serine/threonine phosphatase that has been implicated in microtubule organization at centrosomes. PPP4R2 may be instrumental in targeting PPP4 catalytic subunit (PPP4c) to the centrosomes, and may also regulate (inhibit) the activity of PPP4c at centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (PMID: 10769191). PPP4R2 interacts with Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) protein complex and is essential for differentiation of neuronal cells (PMID: 22559936) as well as for temporal localization of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), suggesting a role in maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs (PMID: 12668731). PPP4R2 is part of a conserved ternary complex including PPP4R3 and PPP4c that mediates dephosphorylation of RPA2 and Î³H2AX, and is required for DNA double strand break repair (PMID: 18614045, 20154705).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-05-15","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":151987,"hugoSymbol":"PPP4R2","name":"protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000356692","curatedRefSeq":"NM_174907.2","geneAliases":["PP4R2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22559936","title":"PPP4R2 regulates neuronal cell differentiation and survival, functionally cooperating with SMN.","journal":"European journal of cell biology","pubDate":"2012 Aug","volume":"91","issue":"8","pages":"662-74","authors":"Bosio Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.03.002","link":null,"reference":"Bosio Y et al.
