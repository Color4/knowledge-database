[{"evidenceId":19698,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"Inhibin alpha (INHA) encodes for the alpha subunit of inhibin A and B protein complex which negatively regulates FSH secretion and negatively regulates gonadal stroma cell proliferation (PMID: 3086749, 6769050, 3092356). Inhibin also regulates erythroid differentiation and placenta development (PMID: 3696240, 3299703). Inhibin has tumor suppressive functions in the gonades, as inhibin loss in gonadal tissue leads to tumor formation (PMID: 1448148).
