[{"evidenceId":10486,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The RHOA gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed small GTPase protein that primarily localizes to the cytoplasm. RHOA cycles between an active, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound, and an inactive, guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound state. Proteins known as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) facilitate activation and inactivation of RHOA respectively. RHOA mediates several cellular functions by activating a number of downstream effectors, including the ROCK-cofilin pathway which stimulates cell motility by causing actin stress fiber formation and contractility (PMID: 25660168). RHOA plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis by mediating invasion of tumor cells, and inhibition of RHOA signaling has shown anti-tumor effect in preclinical models (PMID: 21622195, 25728708, 20364104, 25333508). On the contrary, recent studies have shown that several oncogenic RHOA mutations lead to inactivation of the protein, and RHOA deletion is more common than RHOA amplification in some tumors, suggesting a complex and potentially context-dependent role of RHOA in cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, April. 2015; PMID: 24413737, 24816253).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":387,"hugoSymbol":"RHOA","name":"ras homolog family member A","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000418115","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001664.2","geneAliases":["ARH12","ARHA","RHOH12","RHO12"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25728708","title":"Cooperative induction of apoptosis in NRAS mutant melanoma by inhibition of MEK and ROCK.","journal":"Pigment cell &amp; melanoma research","pubDate":"2015 May","volume":"28","issue":"3","pages":"307-17","authors":"Vogel CJ et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1111/pcmr.12364","link":null,"reference":"Vogel CJ et al.
