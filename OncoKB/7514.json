[{"evidenceId":17795,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The XPO1 (Exportin 1) encodes a protein that mediates nuclear export of proteins and RNA (PMID: 9323132, 10786834). XPO1 recognizes proteins containing a nuclear export signal (NES) and leads to their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. XPO1 has been reported to be involved in ribosome biogenesis by exporting the 60S ribosome subunit through binding to NMD3 (PMID: 26048327, 12724356). In the context of cancer, XPO1 has oncogenic properties. This has been mostly attributed to the fact that proteins exported by XPO1 include important tumor suppressors (eg. APC, TP53, SMARCB1 etc.)(PMID: 12070164, 11782423, 17891139, 20803015). High nuclear XPO1 expression is associated with adverse prognosis in various tumor entities (PMID: 18306389, 19082467, 20003838) and XPO1 mutations have been reported in some cases of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (PMID: 21642962, 26608593). XPO1 translocations have been reported in T-ALL (PMID: 25377562). Small molecule inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) have been developed and tested in preclinical studies in various tumor types and show promising therapeutic efficacy (PMID: 23034282, 23373539, 23970380, 25057921, 24431073, 23588715, 25366336).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7514,"hugoSymbol":"XPO1","name":"exportin 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000401558","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003400.3","geneAliases":["emb","exp1","CRM1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24431073","title":"XPO1 (CRM1) inhibition represses STAT3 activation to drive a survivin-dependent oncogenic switch in triple-negative breast cancer.","journal":"Molecular cancer therapeutics","pubDate":"2014 Mar","volume":"13","issue":"3","pages":"675-86","authors":"Cheng Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0416","link":null,"reference":"Cheng Y et al.
