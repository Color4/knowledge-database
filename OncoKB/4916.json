NTRK3 consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular region harboring the tyrosine kinase domain. Activation of NTRK3 leads to autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of a downstream signaling pathway controlling cell proliferation, survival and differentiation via MAPK, PI3K and PLC-Î³ (PMID: 10851172). NTRK3 has been found altered, mainly in the form of oncogenic fusions, in several human cancers (PMID: 9462753, 11801301, 10895816, 12450792, 9823307, 25207766, 21401966, 24327398, 24135138, 23583981, 24705251). While NTRK3 is overexpressed in some leukemias (PMID: 23832765) it has been found inactivated and transcriptionally downregulated in breast and colon cancer (PMID: 25520870, 23341610, 23874207) showing that NTRK3 may have dual context-dependent roles as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. Treatment strategies for NTRK3-altered cells include broad inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases as well as more specific inhibitors of the NTRK-family of kinases.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4916,"hugoSymbol":"NTRK3","name":"neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000360948","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001012338.2","geneAliases":["TRKC","GP145-TrkC","gp145(trkC)"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24327398","title":"ETV6-NTRK3 is a common chromosomal rearrangement in radiation-associated thyroid cancer.","journal":"Cancer","pubDate":"2014 Mar 15","volume":"120","issue":"6","pages":"799-807","authors":"Leeman-Neill RJ et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1002/cncr.28484","link":null,"reference":"Leeman-Neill RJ et al.
