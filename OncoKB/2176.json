Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome associated with a progressive decline in hematopoietic stem cells, developmental defects, and cancer predisposition (PMID: 24469828). The FA pathway is activated in response to cellular stress that causes interruptions in the replication or transcription processes (PMID: 23114602); it is particularly responsive to a certain type of DNA damage called inter strand cross-links. FANCC has been shown to directly interact with the transcriptional co-repressor, C-terminal-binding protein 1 (PMID: 23303816). Inactivating mutations have been observed in leukemia, oral, breast and pancreatic cancers (PMID: 16998502) and heterozygous mutations have been associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (PMID: 23779253).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2176,"hugoSymbol":"FANCC","name":"Fanconi anemia complementation group C","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000289081","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000136.2","geneAliases":["FA3","FAC","FACC"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24469828","title":"The Fanconi anemia pathway has a dual function in Dickkopf-1 transcriptional repression.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2014 Feb 11","volume":"111","issue":"6","pages":"2152-7","authors":"Huard CC et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.1314226111","link":null,"reference":"Huard CC et al.
