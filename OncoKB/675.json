[{"evidenceId":3448,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor protein; if one copy of the gene is inactivated in the germ line, the result is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease (reviewed in PMID: 22193408). The BRCA2 gene is located on chromosome 13q12-q13 (PMID: 8091231). The primary function of BRCA2 is in homologous recombination (HR). BRCA2 mediates recruitment of RAD51 to double-stranded DNA breaks; RAD51, in turn, allows for HR and the tumor suppressive function of the BRCA2-mediated DNA damage response (PMID: 11239455). The functionally significant regions of the BRCA2 gene are: the N terminus (amino acids 21-39), which binds directly to PALB2 and indirectly to BRCA1 and is crucial to the function of HR repair (PMID: 19369211, 19584259, 19268590, 19609323); the BRC repeats (amino acids 1009-2083), which bind to RAD51; the DNA binding domain, which facilitate binding to both DSS1 and single- and double-stranded DNA (PMID: 12228710, 16205630, 14580353, 20817001); and the C terminus consisting of a nuclear localization sequence and a CDK2 phosphorylation site at S3291 that also binds RAD51 (PMID: 15800615). BRCA2 mutations confer a 50-60% lifetime risk of breast cancer, a 30% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a 20-fold increased risk of prostate cancer, a tenfold increased risk of pancreatic cancer, limited reports of related gastric cancer, and Fanconi anemia subtype D1-associated risk of brain cancer, medulloblastoma, pharyngeal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (reviewed in PMID: 22193408). Preclinical data for the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA2-deficient tumors showed that knock down of the BRCA2 gene in cell lines treated both in vitro and in vivo in nude mice resulted in exquisite sensitivity to the PARP inhibitors NU1025 and AG14361; conversely, knock in of BRCA2 in the mouse model resulted in resistance to AG14361 (PMID: 15829966). An accompanying article showed that PARP depletion, either by knock down with siRNA or treatment with PARP inhibitors, KU0058684 or KU0058948, in combination with deficiency in BRCA1 or BRCA2, was lethal to embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, this group was able to demonstrate that PARP inhibition was more selective in killing BRCA1or BRCA2-mutated cells than was the DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy agent cisplatin (PMID: 15829967).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":675,"hugoSymbol":"BRCA2","name":"BRCA2, DNA repair associated","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000380152","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000059.3","geneAliases":["FANCD1","BROVCA2","XRCC11","FAD","FAD1","BRCC2","GLM3","FACD","FANCD","PNCA2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"19609323","title":"Structural basis for recruitment of BRCA2 by PALB2.","journal":"EMBO reports","pubDate":"2009 Sep","volume":"10","issue":"9","pages":"990-6","authors":"Oliver AW et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/embor.2009.126","link":null,"reference":"Oliver AW et al.
