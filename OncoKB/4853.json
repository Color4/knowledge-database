Four NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1-4) exist in mammals, with NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 genes being the most closely related paralogs (PMID: 26062937). NOTCH2 binds Jagged1/2, and Delta 1, which leads to activation of the NOTCH proteins (PMID: 10221902, 9245493). NOTCH2 is frequently mutated or dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, hematological malignancies, lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer (PMID: 27158037). Similar to NOTCH1 mutations, cancer-associated alterations in NOTCH2 signaling can result in both gain- or loss-of-function outcomes. For example, truncating mutations in NOTCH2, known to cause Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, interrupt the regulation of the protein degradation process, resulting in a functional, but constitutively active intracellular domain (PMID: 15284851, 21378989). Conversely, NOTCH2 activating mutations were observed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (PMID: 24100291, 26168399). Furthermore, frameshift indels or nonsense mutations in NOTCH2 that truncates the PEST domain of the protein have also been observed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma associated with hepatitis C virus (PMID: 25381127).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-30","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4853,"hugoSymbol":"NOTCH2","name":"notch 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000256646","curatedRefSeq":"NM_024408.3","geneAliases":["HJCYS","AGS2","hN2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"10221902","title":"Notch signaling: cell fate control and signal integration in development.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"1999 Apr 30","volume":"284","issue":"5415","pages":"770-6","authors":"Artavanis-Tsakonas S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Artavanis-Tsakonas S et al.
