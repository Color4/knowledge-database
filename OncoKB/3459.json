[{"evidenceId":17811,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"IFNGR1 is a high-affinity subunit of the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) receptor, which is required by macrophages for killing intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria. After binding to interferon-γ, two IFNGR1 molecules form a heterodimeric complex with two IFNGR2 molecules, which initiates interferon signaling. IFNGR1 binds JAK1, and stimulation of the interferon response results in downstream activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 22410872). Three cases of malignancy have been reported in patients with complete IFNGR1 deficiency: human herpesvirus-8 associated Kaposi sarcoma (PMID:15069403), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) related B-cell lymphoma (PMID: 23800860) and pineal germinoma, an intracranial tumor (PMID: 25216720). Mutations in IFNGR1 can result in enhanced susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, and low expression of IFNGR1 leads to a functional blockade of IFN-γ signaling (PMID:15589309). Somatic mutations in IFNGR1 have not yet been identified in human cancers, however, IFNGR1 expression is reduced in some breast cancers (PMID:22182699) and downregulated in a subset of metastatic prostate cancers (PMID:24953652).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3459,"hugoSymbol":"IFNGR1","name":"interferon gamma receptor 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000367739","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000416.2","geneAliases":["IMD27A","IMD27B","CD119","IFNGR"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22410872","title":"The interferons and their receptors--distribution and regulation.","journal":"Immunology and cell biology","pubDate":"2012 May","volume":"90","issue":"5","pages":"483-91","authors":"de Weerd NA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/icb.2012.9","link":null,"reference":"de Weerd NA et al.
