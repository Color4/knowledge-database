A key player in this process is the recombinase RAD51 which acts at an early step in the pathway: the 5’ended DNA strands flanking the break site are resected and the remaining 3’ overhangs are eventually coated by RAD51 forming a nucleo-protein filament (PMID: 25833843). This filament searches for and invades homologous sequences, initiating a process of high-fidelity repair (PMID: 25833843). Several RAD51 paralogs sharing 20-30% amino acid identity have been identified in vertebrates, including RAD51B (PMID: 11751635, 9441753, 21821141, 9512535). RAD51B specifically is involved in DNA repair of double stranded breaks through homologous recombination (PMID: 9441753, 9788630, 15902993, 11283264). RAD51L1 is activated by ionizing radiation (PMID: 9788630) and forms a complex with RAD51L2 and RAD51 for DNA binding to both single- and double-stranded DNA in an ATPase dependent manner (PMID:11751635). In addition to the DNA damage repair pathway, RAD51L1 has been shown to influence cell cycle regulation through phosphorylation of p53, CDK2 and cyclin E leading to a delay in G1 cell cycle phase (PMID: 10623463). Loss of RAD51B in chicken B-lymphocyte DT40 cell lines results in impaired HR and sister chromatid exchange and cells display many other markers of loss of DNA repair functions (PMID 11283264, 10938124). In addition, the function of the central HR protein RAD51 (described above) depends on RAD51B (PMID 11283264, 10938124). Deletion of the RAD51B gene in human colon cancer cell line HCT116 has similar phenotypes as well as centrosome fragmentation and aneuploidy (PMID: 16778173). The former is also seen in knockdowns of RAD51B in the human fibrosarcome cell line HT1080, indicating that haploinsufficiency of RAD51B results in loss of chromosome integrity (PMID: 16778173). RAD51L1 knockout mice showed early embryonic lethality and impaired cell proliferation in homozygote mouse models (PMID: 10567591). Loss of RAD51B function is seen in several cancer types with the implication that loss of its DNA repair functions may potentiate oncogenesis (PMID: 25779941, 25600502, 23001122, 24139550, 21852249, 25313082, 24390348, 19330030, 9892177, 24190013, 23890983).Missense mutations in RAD1L1 occur in many tumors, most notably in breast cancer (PMID: 26472073, 25255808, 24325915, 22454379) and glioblastoma (PMID: 22017238). Additionally, translocations involving the 3' portion of RAD51L1 have been described in patients with uterine leiomyomas (PMID: 9892177, 10565301, 11135437). In particular GWAS studies have identified two SNPs ( rs999737 and rs1314913) as low risk factors for breast cancer (PMID: 21852249, 19330030, 23001122).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5890,"hugoSymbol":"RAD51B","name":"RAD51 paralog B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000487270","curatedRefSeq":"NM_133509.3","geneAliases":["R51H2","REC2","RAD51L1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9512535","title":"Isolation of novel human and mouse genes of the recA/RAD51 recombination-repair gene family.","journal":"Nucleic acids research","pubDate":"1998 Apr 1","volume":"26","issue":"7","pages":"1653-9","authors":"Cartwright R et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Cartwright R et al.
