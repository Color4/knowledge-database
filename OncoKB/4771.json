NF2 is important in indirectly linking actin-transmembrane receptors and intracellular effectors to modulate signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and survival. These include downstream signaling pathways of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), cell adhesion, small GTPases, mTOR, PI3K/Akt and hippo pathways (PMID: 20491622). NF2 is a tumor suppressor. Germline inactivation of NF2 by mutation or deletion results in the autosomal dominant tumor syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 2, which is associated with the development of benign central nervous system (CNS) tumors such as vestibular schwannomas (PMID: 7911002). NF2 is found to be somatically mutated in other types of cancers.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-20","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4771,"hugoSymbol":"NF2","name":"neurofibromin 2 (merlin)","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000338641","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000268.3","geneAliases":["BANF","SCH","ACN"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"20491622","title":"Merlin, a \"magic\" linker between extracellular cues and intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell motility, proliferation, and survival.","journal":"Current protein &amp; peptide science","pubDate":"2010 Sep","volume":"11","issue":"6","pages":"471-84","authors":"Stamenkovic I et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Stamenkovic I et al.
