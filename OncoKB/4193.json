[{"evidenceId":17930,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MDM2 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates the p53 tumor suppressor protein (PMID: 8875929, 1535557, 25550083). The MDM2-p53 interaction blocks the activation domain of p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity (PMID: 8875929, 25550083, 7686617). Additionally, the MDM2-p53 interaction results in increased proteasomal degradation of the p53 protein (PMID: 8653711, 9153396, 9153395, 9382809). Transcription of the MDM2 gene is directly activated by p53, and levels of both p53 and MDM2 are maintained at low levels in unstressed cells (PMID: 8265599, 8440237, 8319905). Cells may acquire oncogenic potential from p53 loss (50% of tumors) or MDM2 amplification, which cripple the p53 pathway in tumor cells (PMID: 10549356, 23161690, 9671804, 20025780). Recently, numerous studies targeting the interaction between p53 and MDM2 have resulted in the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing p53 levels in tumor cells (PMID: 14704432, 15715460, 16759082, 15956260, 17126603, 14704432, 15715460, 16759082, 15956260, 17126603).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-07-31","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4193,"hugoSymbol":"MDM2","name":"MDM2 proto-oncogene","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000462284","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002392.5","geneAliases":["hdm2","HDMX","ACTFS"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8265599","title":"The mdm-2 gene is induced in response to UV light in a p53-dependent manner.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"1993 Dec 15","volume":"90","issue":"24","pages":"11623-7","authors":"Perry ME et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Perry ME et al.
