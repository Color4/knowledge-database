NUF2 is essential for kinetochore-microtubule interactions and spindle checkpoint activity (PMID: 15358233, 15239953, 15548592, 17535814, 15062103). Silencing of NUF2 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in normal and cancer cells (PMID: 12438418, 19878654, 25481014, 25370920, 25374179). The NUF2 gene is amplified in various tumors, including breast, prostate, bladder and liver (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016). NUF2 overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancers (PMID: 24247253), and RNA interference screens have implicated NUF2 as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancers (PMID: 23056589).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":83540,"hugoSymbol":"NUF2","name":"NUF2, NDC80 kinetochore complex component","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000271452","curatedRefSeq":"NM_031423.3","geneAliases":["CT106","CDCA1","NUF2R"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25374179","title":"Silencing of NUF2 inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinomas.","journal":"Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP","pubDate":"2014","volume":"15","issue":"20","pages":"8623-9","authors":"Liu Q et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Liu Q et al.
