[{"evidenceId":18162,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"SOX17 encodes a member of the SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) family of transcription factors and acts as an important antagonist of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of β-catenin/TCF via a GSK3β-independent mechanism. The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in many biological processes including embryonic development to stem cell maintenance. For example, conditional ablation of SOX17 in mouse uterine tissue resulted in inhibition of endometrial adenogenesis and a loss of reproductive capacity (PMID:27102016). Interestingly, conditional deletion of SOX17 from mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) led to the loss of fetal and neonatal but not adult HSCs, proving its importance in the maintenance of fetal and neonatal HSCs but not adult HSCs (PMID:17655922).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-05-05","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":64321,"hugoSymbol":"SOX17","name":"SRY-box 17","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000297316","curatedRefSeq":"NM_022454.3","geneAliases":["VUR3"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"27102016","title":"Conditional deletion of Sox17 reveals complex effects on uterine adenogenesis and function.","journal":"Developmental biology","pubDate":"2016 Jun 15","volume":"414","issue":"2","pages":"219-27","authors":"Guimarães-Young A et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.04.010","link":null,"reference":"Guimarães-Young A et al.
