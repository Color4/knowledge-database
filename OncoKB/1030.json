CDKN2B sits adjacent to CDKN2A on the gene locus and has some redundant functions (PMID: 9479825). CDKN2B binds to CDK4 and CDK6, inhibiting these CDKs from binding D-type Cyclins and phosphorylating the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (PMID: 8259215). These interactions lead to G1 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence, which can serve as a cellular defense mechanism (PMID: 9031081). CDKN2B expression has also been shown to regulate TGFÎ²-mediated cell cycle arrest (PMID: 8078588). Deletion of CDKN2B in murine models can result in tumor progression, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 14681685). CDKN2B is frequently deleted, hypermethylated or mutated in a variety of tumors, and lack or impaired function of CDKN2B may result in dysregulated cellular proliferation (PMID: 9479825). CDKN2B copy number alterations are often the result of a deletion affecting the entire CDKN2A-CDKN2B locus. The oncogenic effects of such deletions are generally attributed to loss of the CDKN2A-encoded tumor suppressors, p16 and p14ARF. Thus, CDKN2B deletion is often considered a passenger event. However, loss of CDKN2B allows for activation of CDK4 and CDK6 and phosphorylation of RB, leading to cell cycle progression beyond the G1 phase. Therefore, tumors with mutations in CDKN2B may be sensitive to pan-CDK or specific CDK4/6 inhibitors. Inhibitors that target CDK proteins, specifically CDK4/6, inhibit the ability of cells to progress through the cell cycle unchecked (PMID: 25633797).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1030,"hugoSymbol":"CDKN2B","name":"cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000276925","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004936.3","geneAliases":["MTS2","P15","TP15","INK4B","CDK4I","p15INK4b"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"9479825","title":"The INK4 family of CDK inhibitors.","journal":"Current topics in microbiology and immunology","pubDate":"1998","volume":"227","issue":"","pages":"43-55","authors":"Carnero A et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Carnero A et al.
