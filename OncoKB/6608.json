[{"evidenceId":2519,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"Smoothened (SMO) is a conserved signal transducer of the hedgehog signaling pathway, playing important roles in normal embryonic and neuronal development as well as tumorigenesis (PMID: 23719536, 21614026, 26912893). SMO is a seven-transmembrane domain protein bearing some structural and functional similarity to G-protein coupled receptors (PMID: 23636324). SMO activity is normally inhibited by patched (PTCH1), an upstream component of the Hedgehog pathway, via poorly understood mechanisms (PMID: 23719536). Binding of extracellular Hedgehog ligands to PTCH1 leads to consecutive activation of SMO, which in turn induces modifications of the downstream GLI transcription factors leading to their activation. Activating mutations in SMO lead to constitutive activation of GLI-mediated transcription of important oncogenic genes. Such mutations have been implicated in sporadic basal cell carcinoma (PMID: 9422511, 26950094) and medulloblastoma (PMID: 21614026) and have been identified in many other tumor types. Recent efforts have been made to specifically target SMO (PMID: 26781311, 26931153, 26919418, 26843616, 26527777). A distinct set of mutations in the ligand binding pocket of SMO, however, has been described to confer resistance to SMO inhibitors such as vismodegib and related cyclopamine drugs (PMID: 25759014, 26960983).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6608,"hugoSymbol":"SMO","name":"smoothened, frizzled class receptor","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000249373","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005631.4","geneAliases":["Gx","FZD11","SMOH"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26843616","title":"In vitro and in vivo inhibition of breast cancer cell growth by targeting the Hedgehog/GLI pathway with SMO (GDC-0449) or GLI (GANT-61) inhibitors.","journal":"Oncotarget","pubDate":"2016 Feb 23","volume":"7","issue":"8","pages":"9250-70","authors":"Benvenuto M et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7062","link":null,"reference":"Benvenuto M et al.
