The MED12 protein is essential for activating CDK8 kinase. The CDK8 subcomplex which includes MED13, CDK8 kinase and cyclin C, modulates mediator-polymerase II interactions thereby regulating transcription initiation and reinitiation rates (RefSeq August 2009). The most commonly seen mutations in MED12 are in exon 2. Mutations in this domain have been described in uterine leiomyomas (PMID: 25108465, 24980722, 23443020, 23738515), breast fibroadenomas (PMID: 25038752), and Phyllodes tumors of the breast (PMID: 25593300). In benign breast tumors, MED12 hotspot mutations are thought to be early events that lead to deregulation of estrogen signaling (PMID: 25593300). MED12 is the most frequently mutated gene in uterine leiomyomas, suggesting it has a major role in the development of these lesions (PMID: 25108465). MED12 somatic exon 2 mutations have also been described in uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (PMID: 23132392). The presence of the same MED12 mutations in uLMS as in uterine leiomyomas suggests that a subgroup of the malignant tumors may develop from a leiomyoma precursor. Leucine (L) to Phenylalanine (F) mutations at amino acid 1224 have been described in prostate cancer. These mutations are thought to play a role in tumorigenesis via perturbation of transcriptional programs linked to p53 and androgen signaling (PMID: 22610119).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9968,"hugoSymbol":"MED12","name":"mediator complex subunit 12","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000374080","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005120.2","geneAliases":["ARC240","TNRC11","TRAP230","OKS","MED12S","HOPA","CAGH45","FGS1","OHDOX"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25038752","title":"Exome sequencing identifies highly recurrent MED12 somatic mutations in breast fibroadenoma.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2014 Aug","volume":"46","issue":"8","pages":"877-80","authors":"Lim WK et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.3037","link":null,"reference":"Lim WK et al.
