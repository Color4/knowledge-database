DEAH helicases participate in pre-messenger RNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis (PMID: 20168331). This family of genes includes those that have been implicated in heritable human diseases, including BLM, WRN and RECQL4 (PMID: 24606147). Specifically, BRIP1 interacts with the BRCT motif-containing domain of BRCA1 (PMID: 17033622). In the HCC1937 cell line that produces BRCA1 with a truncated C-terminal, BRIP1 failed to co-immunoprecipitate with BRCA1, suggesting this domain is important for interaction with BRIP1 (PMID: 11301010). In the same study, two intact BRCT repeat units on BRCA1 were shown to be necessary for the BRCA1 and BRIP1 interaction; a mutation at K52R on BRIP1 may control the interaction of the two proteins. BRIP1 has been shown to be mutated in hereditary breast (PMID: 11301010, 17033622), ovarian (PMID: 21964575) and prostate (PMID: 19127258) cancers as well as the Fanconi anemia (FA), a disorder caused by genetic defects in a number of proteins involved in DNA repair that is characterized by bone marrow failure, sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and the development of cancer, often acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (PMID: 24348213, 16493006). Cell lines that are deficient in BRIP1 are sensitive to mitomycin C, a crosslinking agent (PMID: 16153896).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-23","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":83990,"hugoSymbol":"BRIP1","name":"BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000259008","curatedRefSeq":"NM_032043.2","geneAliases":["FANCJ","OF"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21964575","title":"Mutations in BRIP1 confer high risk of ovarian cancer.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2011 Oct 2","volume":"43","issue":"11","pages":"1104-7","authors":"Rafnar T et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.955","link":null,"reference":"Rafnar T et al.
