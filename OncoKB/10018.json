[{"evidenceId":5642,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"BCL2L11 encodes BIM, a pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor in the BCL2 protein family that inhibits BCL2 anti-apoptotic activity (PMID: 9731710, 9430630). The relative levels of BIM and BCL2 in the cell regulate the downstream apoptosis pathway and thus are involved in cell survival, tissue homeostasis and cancer progression (PMID: 9430630, 10576740, 25176652). BIM expression is epigenetically silenced in chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 19403302, 20647567). Furthermore, BIM expression has been shown to be a predictor of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in various tumor types (PMID: 22145099), thus Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics may have utility in cancers that are resistant to TKIs through a BIM-dependent mechanism (PMID: 18949058).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10018,"hugoSymbol":"BCL2L11","name":"BCL2 like 11","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000393256","curatedRefSeq":"NM_138621.4","geneAliases":["BOD","BIM","BAM"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"20647567","title":"Epigenetic silencing of BIM in glucocorticoid poor-responsive pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and its reversal by histone deacetylase inhibition.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2010 Oct 21","volume":"116","issue":"16","pages":"3013-22","authors":"Bachmann PS et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-284968","link":null,"reference":"Bachmann PS et al.
