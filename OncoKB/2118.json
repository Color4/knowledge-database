The family consists of a highly conserved group of genes that play important roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis (PMID: 21548782). ETV4 in particular plays an important role in development, such as in organogenesis of the kidney, mammary gland, and limb buds (PMID: 9285689, 12871699, 19386269). ETV4 is overexpressed in various types of solid cancers, including the esophagus (PMID: 21143918), colon (PMID: 15695237), breast (PMID: 21404275,15387369), ovarian (PMID:12684413), non-small lung (PMID: 11519038) and gastric (PMID: 14604892), where it promotes metastatic progression and correlates with reduced survival. In prostate cancers (~1% of the cases) ETV4 overexpression is associated with translocation of ETV4 to the promoter of a gene highly expressed in prostate (TMPRSS2, KLK2, DDX5, and CANT1) (PMID: 18794152, 16585160, 18451133). Finally, fusions of ETV4 with Ewing's sarcoma (EWSR1) gene have been reported in three cases of Ewing sarcoma (ES) (PMID: 8834175, 8605035, 22429598). The defining feature of these tumors are chromosomal translocations involving the EWSR1 gene and one of five ETS genes.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2118,"hugoSymbol":"ETV4","name":"ETS variant 4","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000319349","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001079675.2","geneAliases":["E1AF","PEA3","PEAS3","E1A-F"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8834175","title":"Fusion of an ETS-family gene, EIAF, to EWS by t(17;22)(q12;q12) chromosome translocation in an undifferentiated sarcoma of infancy.","journal":"Genes, chromosomes &amp; cancer","pubDate":"1996 Feb","volume":"15","issue":"2","pages":"115-21","authors":"Kaneko Y et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Kaneko Y et al.
