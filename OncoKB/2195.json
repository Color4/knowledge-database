FAT1 is involved in the promotion of actin-mediated cell migration as well as inhibition of YAP1-mediated cell proliferation. FAT1 is a potent suppressor of cancer cell growth, owing to its ability to bind β-catenin and abrogate its nuclear localization and transcription of its targets. Alterations in FAT1 decrease its interaction with β-catenin, thus promoting WNT signaling and tumorigenesis. Although most FAT1 alterations in cancer are loss-of-function events (cBioPortal, MSKCC, May 2015), studies suggest that it can be both tumor suppressive or oncogenic in a context-dependent manner (PMID: 8586420, 23076869,19439659, 16682528, 23354438).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2195,"hugoSymbol":"FAT1","name":"FAT atypical cadherin 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000441802","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005245.3","geneAliases":["CDHF7","FAT","hFat1","ME5","CDHR8"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"8586420","title":"Molecular cloning and tissue expression of FAT, the human homologue of the Drosophila fat gene that is located on chromosome 4q34-q35 and encodes a putative adhesion molecule.","journal":"Genomics","pubDate":"1995 Nov 20","volume":"30","issue":"2","pages":"207-23","authors":"Dunne J et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Dunne J et al.
