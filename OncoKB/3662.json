It can homo- or heterodimerize with other transcription factors to bind DNA (PMID:12453417). IRF4 is important for immune response and in NFkB signaling as a downstream mediator (PMID: 10601358,17785208). It regulates the development and survival of B- and T-cells (PMID:15249594, 24591370, 24356538). Its activity is also involved in melanocyte pigmentation (PMID:24267888). Expression of IRF4 (also known as MUM1) is used to classify diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes (PMID:12393466). Translocations involving IRF4 and the IgH locus have been identified in myeloma and with additional gene loci in lymphomas (PMID: 9326949, 18987657, 15510210). IRF4 polymorphisms have also been linked to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) susceptibility and mutations are found in T-cell leukemia and lymphomas (PMID: 18758461, 26437031).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3662,"hugoSymbol":"IRF4","name":"interferon regulatory factor 4","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000380956","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002460.3","geneAliases":["NF-EM5","LSIRF","SHEP8"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9326949","title":"Deregulation of MUM1/IRF4 by chromosomal translocation in multiple myeloma.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"1997 Oct","volume":"17","issue":"2","pages":"226-30","authors":"Iida S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Iida S et al.
