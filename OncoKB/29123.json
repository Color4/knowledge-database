ANKRD11 has also been identified as a coactivator of the p53 tumor suppressor (PMID: 18840648), thereby influencing many pathways relevant to cancer, including transcriptional initiation, cell cycle regulation, ion transport and Notch signaling. Heterozygous mutations in ANKRD11 have been reported to cause KBG syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and macrodontia (PMID: 21782149 ).
