[{"evidenceId":18416,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"TSHR encodes for the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, a transmembrane protein that binds thyrothropin and thyrostimulin (PMID:2556796). TSHR is expressed in the thyroid gland and regulates growth of thyroid cells and release of thyroid hormone (PMID:24931193). It belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors (PMID:18719020). Activation of the receptor results higher cAMP levels, increased Protein Kinase A activity, and phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors, such as cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB) (PMID:11158328). TSHR may also activate other pathways including the Ras-MAPK, Protein Kinase C, and NFkB pathways (PMID:11039907,15062572,18719020). Germline activating mutations result in hyperthyroidism; while loss of function mutations lead to hypothyroidism (PMID:7920658, 23154162, 20926595). Activating mutations are found in thyroid carcinomas (PMID:7478621,26260781). TSHR pathway activation has been found to cooperate with BRAF mutations in thyroid tumor initiation (PMID:21220306).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7253,"hugoSymbol":"TSHR","name":"thyroid stimulating hormone receptor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000298171","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000369.2","geneAliases":["CHNG1","LGR3","hTSHR-I"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26260781","title":"Mutations of TSHR and TP53 Genes in an Aggressive Clear Cell Follicular Carcinoma of the Thyroid.","journal":"Endocrine pathology","pubDate":"2015 Dec","volume":"26","issue":"4","pages":"315-9","authors":"Tong GX et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1007/s12022-015-9388-1","link":null,"reference":"Tong GX et al.
