Upon sensing a DNA DSB, XRCC2 transduces a signal to the repair machinery in RAD51 to initiate strand repair by homologous recombination and to arrest cell cycle progression. XRCC2 is one of five RAD51 paralogs (genes with similar functions of common origin) including XRCC3, RAD51B, RAD51C and RAD51D (PMID: 9126486,10517641). Although the specific functional contributions of each RAD51 paralog are not completely delineated, functional implications in the fidelity and efficiency of DSB repair in the setting of XRCC2 deficiency show that in animal models and in vitro assays, XRCC2 knockdown results in a 100-fold decrease in DSB repair function through defective homologous recombination repair (PMID: 10517641, 14678973, 14645207, 24627042). There is conflicting data on whether germline variants of XRCC2 increase the risk of breast cancer (PMID: 22464251, 23054243). Retrospective genome wide association studies (GWAS) of patients with breast cancer revealed that patients heterozygous for the R188H variant, which is not located in a functional domain, had an increased risk for breast cancer, which approached but did not reach significance, but a decreased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (PMID: 12023982, 17141189, 15924337).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7516,"hugoSymbol":"XRCC2","name":"X-ray repair cross complementing 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000359321","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005431.1","geneAliases":["FANCU"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"9126486","title":"The XRCC2 DNA repair gene: identification of a positional candidate.","journal":"Genomics","pubDate":"1997 Apr 1","volume":"41","issue":"1","pages":"84-92","authors":"Tambini CE et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Tambini CE et al.
