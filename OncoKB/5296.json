[{"evidenceId":3022,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PIK3R2, also known as p55-Î², is a regulatory subunit of PI3K and functions to regulate activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via direct interaction (PMID: 12094235). It is thus important in regulating various downstream activities in the cell, such as growth, proliferation and motility. Upon RTK activation, PIK3R2 helps recruit the PI3K enzymatic complex to the cell membrane and allows the PI3K catalytic subunit to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is important in activating downstream signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR (PMID:12040186). PIK3R2 mutations are often found in endometrial cancers with wildtype PTEN, and allow for increased PI3K and downstream AKT signaling (PMID: 21984976).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5296,"hugoSymbol":"PIK3R2","name":"phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000222254","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005027.3","geneAliases":["P85B","MPPH1","p85-BETA","p85","MPPH"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12040186","title":"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2002 May 31","volume":"296","issue":"5573","pages":"1655-7","authors":"Cantley LC","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Cantley LC.
