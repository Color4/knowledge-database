In addition, S6K2 plays a role in learning, memory and synaptic plasticity (PMID: 18174371). S6K2 is activated upon stimulation of cells with insulin, serum or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate by effectors of the PI3K signaling pathway, such as Rac, CDC42, PDK1 and PKC-ζ (PMID: 9804755, 10490846, 11108711, 8653792, 9445476, 10082559, 12529391). Genetic variations in RPS6KB2 are associated with Alzheimer disease (PMID: 21811019). S6K2 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels found in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and central nervous system; levels in normal tissues are relatively low, compared with levels in corresponding tumor samples (PMID: 21444676, 16810323). High levels of S6K2 are found in adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 15627062, 21748818, 15995633, 15627061, 20953835, 16810323, 23393338). Expression and localization of RPS6KB2 are distinguishing features of cancer cells (PMID: 15627062). Amplification of RPS6KB2 has prognostic value and can help predict treatment success in breast cancer. In endometrial and gastric cancers, the level of nuclear expression of RPS6KB2 correlates with tumor grade and decreased overall survival. In lung cancer, increased expression of S6K2 is correlated with drug resistance (PMID: 15627062, 21748818, 15995633, 15627061, 20953835, 16810323). Somatic mutations are found in lung adenocarcinomas in nonsmokers and are associated with worse survival (PMID: 24894543). Polymorphisms in RPS6KB2 are associated with a risk of developing colon cancer and rectal cancer (PMID: 21035469).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6199,"hugoSymbol":"RPS6KB2","name":"ribosomal protein S6 kinase B2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000312629","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003952.2","geneAliases":["P70-beta-1","P70-beta","P70-beta-2","STK14B","KLS","p70(S6K)-beta","S6K-beta2","S6K2","p70S6Kb","SRK"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21811019","title":"Genetic variation in the tau kinases pathway may modify the risk and age at onset of Alzheimer's disease.","journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","pubDate":"2011","volume":"27","issue":"2","pages":"291-7","authors":"Vázquez-Higuera JL et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3233/JAD-2011-110794","link":null,"reference":"Vázquez-Higuera JL et al.
