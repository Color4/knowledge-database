PRKCI protects BCR-ABL leukemia cells from undergoing apoptosis (PMID: 9346882). It also enhances cell proliferation and survival via NF-KB pathway activation (PMID: 10467349, 10356400). PRKCI promotes colony formation and tumor growth in vivo (PMID: 15994303) and cooperates with SOX2 to activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway in lung cancers (PMID: 24525231). PRKCI phosphorylates BAD in glioma cells, thus allowing them to evade apoptosis (PMID: 21419810). PRKCI is frequently altered by amplification in several cancers, including lung, ovarian, esophageal and head and neck carcinomas (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5584,"hugoSymbol":"PRKCI","name":"protein kinase C iota","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000295797","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002740.5","geneAliases":["DXS1179E","PKCI","nPKC-iota"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"10467349","title":"Overexpression of atypical PKC in PC12 cells enhances NGF-responsiveness and survival through an NF-kappaB dependent pathway.","journal":"Cell death and differentiation","pubDate":"1999 Aug","volume":"6","issue":"8","pages":"753-64","authors":"Wooten MW et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Wooten MW et al.
