SLX4 localizes at double-strand breaks (DSB), where it forms a multi-protein complex by recruiting proteins involved in DNA repair and genome stability, such as ERCC1/ERCC4 and SLX1 endonucleases, MSH2/MSH3 mismatch repair complex, and telomeric TRF2, among others (PMID: 19596235, 19596236, 19595721, 19595722). SLX4 is essential in several types of DNA repair, including DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), Holliday junction (HJ) resolution and telomere homeostasis (PMID: 24938228). SLX4 is mutated at low frequencies in various tumors. Germline mutations in SLX4 are the cause of a subtype of Fanconi anemia (FANCP) (PMID: 21240275, 21240277). SLX4 was studied as a putative genetic factor in familial non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer patients, but several studies failed to demonstrate its contribution (PMID: 22911665, 22401137, 21805310, 23211700).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":84464,"hugoSymbol":"SLX4","name":"SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000294008","curatedRefSeq":"NM_032444.2","geneAliases":["MUS312","FANCP","BTBD12"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22911665","title":"Analysis of the novel fanconi anemia gene SLX4/FANCP in familial breast cancer cases.","journal":"Human mutation","pubDate":"2013 Jan","volume":"34","issue":"1","pages":"70-3","authors":"Bakker JL et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1002/humu.22206","link":null,"reference":"Bakker JL et al.
