[{"evidenceId":17850,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The KDM5C gene encodes a member of an ARID protein family that acts as an epigenetic regulator by removing di-tri-methyl groups from lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) on transcriptional targets (PMID: 21575681, 24583395, 20054297, 22249190). KDM5C is ubiquitously expressed in almost all human tissues, including white blood cells, with the highest levels of expression found in the brain and skeletal muscle (PMID: 23356856). Loss of KDM5C exerts an essential role in mammalian DNA replication. Moreover, KDM5C silencing induces aberrant H3K4me3 levels at active origins, thus halting DNA replication and ultimately S phase progression (PMID: 25712104). Mutation of the KDM5C gene was first described as causing X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in 2005 (PMID: 15586325), and has been linked to some forms of cancer (PMID: 21544224, 20181063, 20133580). The prevalence of KDM5C mutations in patients with XLID is estimated to be ~3% (PMID: 23356856), and somatic mutations in this gene have been identified in 4-9% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (PMID: 20054297, 24166983, 22138691). Knockdown of KDM5C in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) -/- ccRCC cells significantly enhanced tumor growth in a xenograft model, suggesting that KDM5C functions as a tumor suppressor in this cancer model (PMID: 21725364, 25111482). Through siRNA screen, KDM5C was identified as a mediator of the human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 tumor suppressor protein in cervical cancer (PMID: 20133580).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8242,"hugoSymbol":"KDM5C","name":"lysine demethylase 5C","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000375401","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004187.3","geneAliases":["MRXJ","JARID1C","MRX13","MRXSCJ","MRXSJ","SMCX","DXS1272E","XE169"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24166983","title":"Clinical and pathological impact of VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM6A, and JARID1c in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","journal":"Genes, chromosomes &amp; cancer","pubDate":"2014 Jan","volume":"53","issue":"1","pages":"38-51","authors":"Gossage L et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1002/gcc.22116","link":null,"reference":"Gossage L et al.
