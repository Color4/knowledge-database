PRKD1 is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and is able to phosphorylate EGFR, among other targets, leading to signaling suppression (PMID: 17703233, 10523301, 21209314). PRKD1 plays a role in apoptosis and NF-kB-mediated response to oxidative stress (PMID: 10764790, 12505989). PRKD1 has also been implicated in VEGF-induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells (PMID: 18332134) and in the KRAS-mediated methylator phenotype of colorectal cancers (PMID: 24623306). The PRKD1 gene is mutated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and salivary gland adenocarcinomas (PMID: 25240283, 25303977). Small molecule inhibitors against PRKD1 and other protein kinase D isoforms are available (PMID: 20442301).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5587,"hugoSymbol":"PRKD1","name":"protein kinase D1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000331968","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002742.2","geneAliases":["PKCM","PKD","PKC-MU","PRKCM"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21209314","title":"A novel protein kinase D phosphorylation site in the tumor suppressor Rab interactor 1 is critical for coordination of cell migration.","journal":"Molecular biology of the cell","pubDate":"2011 Mar 1","volume":"22","issue":"5","pages":"570-80","authors":"Ziegler S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1091/mbc.E10-05-0427","link":null,"reference":"Ziegler S et al.
