It functions to transduce signaling from Toll-like receptors and the Interleukin-1 receptor important for innate immunity (PMID: 16413925, 12467250, 11544529). Signaling through MYD88 activates the NFkB pathway (PMID: 9734363). Patients with MYD88 loss of function mutations are more susceptible to bacterial infections due to immune dysfunction (PMID:18669862). Activating mutations of MYD88, particularly the L265P mutation, are frequently identified in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia patients (PMID: 22931316).
