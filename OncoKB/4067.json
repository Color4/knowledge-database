[{"evidenceId":19193,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The LYN gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family (PMID: 9202419). LYN is involved in immune responses, B-cell signaling, signal transduction of growth factors and response to DNA damage, among other functions (PMID: 19290919, 10574931, 11825908, 11435302). LYN is a mediator that can positively or negatively regulate different processes depending on the cellular and physiological context (PMID: 15664155). LYN has been described to promote tumor growth, invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ERK signaling in different cancer contexts (PMID: 20215510, 22490227, 22731636). The LYN gene is typically altered by amplification in various tumors, including prostate, breast and ovarian cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016). LYN can be pharmacologically targeted with Src-kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib (PMID: 20215510, 22490227, 18056483).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4067,"hugoSymbol":"LYN","name":"LYN proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000519728","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002350.3","geneAliases":["p53Lyn","p56Lyn","JTK8"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20215510","title":"LYN is a mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and a target of dasatinib in breast cancer.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2010 Mar 15","volume":"70","issue":"6","pages":"2296-306","authors":"Choi YL et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3141","link":null,"reference":"Choi YL et al.
