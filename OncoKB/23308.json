Co-stimulator ligands like ICOSLG are typically required for activation of T-cells, cytokine production, and antigen recognition by the T-cell receptor. ICOSLG binds to the co-stimulatory receptor, ICOS, which shares similar structural and functional similarities to CD28. ICOSLG expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells has been associated with disease progression (PMID: 23026134) and may serve as a potential biomarker of trastuzumab resistance (PMID: 25449779) in breast cancer. Germline mutations of ICOSLG and its promoter region are associated with common variable immunodeficiency and Alopecia areata (PMID: 23196741, 15963052).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":23308,"hugoSymbol":"ICOSLG","name":"inducible T-cell costimulator ligand","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000407780","curatedRefSeq":"NM_015259.4","geneAliases":["CD275","B7H2","GL50","B7RP1","B7-H2","B7RP-1","ICOS-L","ICOSL","LICOS"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25449779","title":"A pathway-based approach for identifying biomarkers of tumor progression to trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.","journal":"Cancer letters","pubDate":"2015 Jan 28","volume":"356","issue":"2 Pt B","pages":"880-90","authors":"Nam S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2014.10.038","link":null,"reference":"Nam S et al.
