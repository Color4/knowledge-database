[{"evidenceId":19770,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme. CYLD specifically removes lysine-63-linked ubiquitin marks. It negatively regulates NF-κB signaling by deubiquitinating upstream regulators such as TRAF2 and TRAF6 (PMID: 12917689, 12917691). CYLD has a tumor suppressor role, principally via NF-κB pathway inhibition and enhancement of apoptosis (PMID: 12917690). Despite its recognized tumor suppressor role, CYLD also modulates microtubule dynamics and plays roles in cell migration and angiogenesis (PMID: 18222923, 20194890). CYLD is involved in other physiological processes, such as immune response, inflammation, cell cycle progression, spermatogenesis and osteoclastogenesis (PMID: 19373246). CYLD is mutated at low frequencies in various tumors. Around 25% of CYLD alterations are truncating mutations (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Jan. 2017). Germline mutations in CYLD gene have been associated with cylindromatosis, multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (PMID: 26370355, 20502185, 16307661, 26329847).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1540,"hugoSymbol":"CYLD","name":"CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000398568","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001042355.1","geneAliases":["CYLDI","MFT1","SBS","EAC","CDMT","CYLD1","MFT","USPL2","TEM","BRSS"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19373246","title":"CYLD: a tumor suppressor deubiquitinase regulating NF-kappaB activation and diverse biological processes.","journal":"Cell death and differentiation","pubDate":"2010 Jan","volume":"17","issue":"1","pages":"25-34","authors":"Sun SC","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.43","link":null,"reference":"Sun SC.
