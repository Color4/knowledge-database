[{"evidenceId":18920,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"SRSF2 encodes serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2, an RNA splicing factor. Mutations result in aberrant pre-mRNA splicing and exon mis-recognition (PMID:26124281, 25965569). In hematopoietic cells, key regulatory genes such as EZH2 are mis-spliced with its mutation (PMID:25965569). Mutations cluster at specific sites and can affect RNA recognition (PMID:26261309). SRSF2 mutations are found in myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and myeloid disorders (PMID:21909114, 25550361, 25231745, 26464169, 23660863).
