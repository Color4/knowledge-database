PD-L1 acts to inhibit an immune response by binding to the PD-1 cell surface receptor, which is expressed by T cells, B cells and natural killer cells (PMID: 17629517). PD-L1 allows tumor cells to evade the host immune system by suppressing the T cell response. Amplification or overexpression of PD-L1 has been identified in some tumor types and can be predictive of responses to immunotherapy (PMID: 22437870, 26918453, 28652380, 27620277), suggesting that PD-L1 functions as an oncogene. Individuals with tumors expressing PD-L1 should be considered for immune checkpoint therapy. Atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 28424325) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy (PMID: 28611199). Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, is considered first-line therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanomas that express PD-L1, and may be efficacious in other tumors that express PD-L1 (PMID: 28806116). Nivolumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1, is also effective in tumors with high PD-L1 expression due to the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and activation of a robust immune response (PMID: 28806116).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":29126,"hugoSymbol":"CD274","name":"CD274 molecule","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000381577","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014143.3","geneAliases":["B7H1","PD-L1","PDCD1L1","PDCD1LG1","PDL1","B7-H"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"28611199","title":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approval Summary: Atezolizumab for Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","journal":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","pubDate":"2017 Aug 15","volume":"23","issue":"16","pages":"4534-4539","authors":"Weinstock C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-0540","link":null,"reference":"Weinstock C et al.
