[{"evidenceId":18991,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RRAS encodes R-Ras, a member of the Rassubfamily of small GTPases, which is involved in diverse processes includingangiogenesis, vascular homeostasis, vascular regeneration, cell adhesion andneuronal axon guidance. R-Ras signaling regulates the organization of the actincytoskeleton and promotes the formation of ruffling lamellipodia via its activationof phospholipase Cε (PMID: 16537651). R-Ras regulates Integrin β1 activity andaffects cell adhesion, cell spreading, cell polarization and phagocytosis (PMID: 8620538,18270267, 11257001). In addition, R-Ras inhibits angiogenesis and endothelialcell vessel sprouting but promotes vascular homeostasis due to its effect onVascular endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling (PMID: 27029009). Germlinemutations in this gene are found in disorders related to Noonan Syndrome collectively called \"RASopathies\", and somatic alterations have been found to beassociated with hematologic and pediatric cancers (PMID: 24705357).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6237,"hugoSymbol":"RRAS","name":"related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000246792","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006270.3","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16537651","title":"The small GTPase R-Ras regulates organization of actin and drives membrane protrusions through the activity of PLCepsilon.","journal":"Journal of cell science","pubDate":"2006 Apr 1","volume":"119","issue":"Pt 7","pages":"1307-19","authors":"Ada-Nguema AS et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Ada-Nguema AS et al.
