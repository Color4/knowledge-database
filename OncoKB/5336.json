The enzyme is autoinhibited by a C-terminal SH2 domain and activated by phosphorylation (PMID:20807769). It is expressed mainly in B-cells and Natural Killer cells where it acts to transduce signals from the immunglobulin family of receptors (PMID:10933392, 16002670). It is also involved in regulating osteoclast development (PMID:17053833). Mutations and deletions have been associated with autoimmunity and immune dysregulation (PMID:22236196, 23000145). Mutations in PLCG2 are found as resistance mechanisms to Ibruitinib therapy in CLL patients (PMID:24869598). These activating mutations result in Btk independent signaling from the B-cell receptor (PMID:25972157). Polymorphisms in PLCG2 have also been associated with cancer development risk (PMID:24080446, 23874846)","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5336,"hugoSymbol":"PLCG2","name":"phospholipase C gamma 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000359376","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002661.3","geneAliases":["PLC-IV","PLC-gamma-2","APLAID","FCAS3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25972157","title":"Hypermorphic mutation of phospholipase C, γ2 acquired in ibrutinib-resistant CLL confers BTK independency upon B-cell receptor activation.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2015 Jul 2","volume":"126","issue":"1","pages":"61-8","authors":"Liu TM et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-02-626846","link":null,"reference":"Liu TM et al.
