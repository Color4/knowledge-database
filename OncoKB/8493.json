[{"evidenceId":18283,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The PPM1D gene encodes the Protein Phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent, 1D, a member of the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. PPM1D is induced by p53 following activation in response to various environmental stresses such as radiation, H2O2, and anisomycin (PMID: 19015127, 22201816). PPM1D is emerging as an important oncogene by virtue of its negative control on several key tumor suppressor pathways including ATM, CHK2, p38 MAPK, and p53 (PMID: 19879149). PPM1D is overexpressed and/or mutated in various human primary cancers, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian carcinoma and neuroblastoma (PMID: 19879149, 23242139, 17233815, 19293255). High PPM1D expression has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and prostate cancer (PMID: 25412952, 25060857,26714478). Finally, various PPM1D inhibitors, including peptidic inhibitors derived from substrate sequences and small chemical inhibitors, were reported that suppress cancer cell growth and could be useful in the development of effective anti-cancer agents (PMID: 18845566, 21528848, 17073441, 24390428, 22115592, 25466181, 26358280)","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-06","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8493,"hugoSymbol":"PPM1D","name":"protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000305921","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003620.3","geneAliases":["PP2C-DELTA","WIP1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25412952","title":"PPM1D overexpression predicts poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer.","journal":"Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine","pubDate":"2015 Mar","volume":"36","issue":"3","pages":"2179-84","authors":"Yang H et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2828-6","link":null,"reference":"Yang H et al.
