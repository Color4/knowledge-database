It is a member of a family of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). VEGFA signaling in tumor cells is mediated by the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, with almost all of the known cellular responses mediated by VEGFR-2 (PMID: 16951216). Other types of receptors contribute to VEGFA signaling including platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PMID: 17470632) and neuropilins (PMID: 22948112, 23116416). Autocrine VEGF signaling is generally characteristic of more aggressive cancers (PMID: 22693250) and has been shown to promote the function of cancer stem cells (PMID: 22012397, 20141840). VEGFA also affects the function of nearby immune cells (PMID: 23045606) and fibroblasts (PMID: 22738912) and may also act within tumor cells to regulate survival (PMID: 21057529). VEGFA is an oncogene commonly over-expressed in many solid tumors. Both somatic and germline mutations are known but it is not commonly mutated in any cancer type (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2016). Germline polymorphisms in VEGFA have been associated with recurrent depressive disorder development (PMID: 23673188). Bevacizumab (PMID: 17212999) and aflibercept (PMID: 22446028) are VEGFA inhibitors FDA-approved for metastatic colorectal cancer.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7422,"hugoSymbol":"VEGFA","name":"vascular endothelial growth factor A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000523873","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001171623.1","geneAliases":["MVCD1","VEGF","VPF"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22012397","title":"A vascular niche and a VEGF-Nrp1 loop regulate the initiation and stemness of skin tumours.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2011 Oct 19","volume":"478","issue":"7369","pages":"399-403","authors":"Beck B et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature10525","link":null,"reference":"Beck B et al.
