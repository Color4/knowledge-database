PIK3CG is involved in extracellular signaling and linking cell-surface receptors to intracellular signaling networks, such as the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway (PMID:12040186). Once activated, AKT-mTOR downstream signaling promotes cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility (PMID: 16341083). PIK3CG is primarily expressed in white blood cells, and through its direct interactions with RAS and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (PMID:12507995) is important in immune cell responses and inflammatory stimuli (PMID:10669418). Deletions of PIK3CG are often found in myeloid malignancies, and PIK3CG is thought to be a tumor suppressor in these settings (PMID: 11756194).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5294,"hugoSymbol":"PIK3CG","name":"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit gamma","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000359195","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002649.2","geneAliases":["PI3K","PIK3","p120-PI3K","PI3CG","p110gamma","PI3Kgamma"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16341083","title":"Oncogenic PI3K deregulates transcription and translation.","journal":"Nature reviews.
