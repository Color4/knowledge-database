In hypoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) protein stabilization leads to upregulation of KDR and VEGF (PMID: 23172303). Binding of VEGF to KDR results in stimulation of angiogenesis via receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, activation of phospholipase C (PLC-gamma) and downstream signaling via protein kinase C (PKC) and RAF/MEK/ERK (PMID: 10327068, 12778165). Mutations of KDR are rare in tumors, and alterations of KDR activity typically occur via KDR amplification and subsequent overexpression. Most therapies blocking KDR signaling target the angiogenesis pathway in general, such as bevacizumab, an antibody that targets VEGF-A (PMID: 15136787).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3791,"hugoSymbol":"KDR","name":"kinase insert domain receptor","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263923","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002253.2","geneAliases":["VEGFR2","CD309","VEGFR","FLK1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12778165","title":"The biology of VEGF and its receptors.","journal":"Nature medicine","pubDate":"2003 Jun","volume":"9","issue":"6","pages":"669-76","authors":"Ferrara N et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Ferrara N et al.
