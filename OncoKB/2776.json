[{"evidenceId":15573,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The GNAQ (guanine nucleotide binding protein q polypeptide) gene encodes for members of the q class of G-protein alpha subunit, one of three subunits that comprise the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins). These G-proteins participate in signal transduction between G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and downstream effector pathways including the MAPK pathway. Mutations in GNAQ cause activation of the MAPK pathway through the upregulation of protein kinase C (PMID:19078957). Mutations in codon 209 (within the RAS-like domain) transform GNAQ into a dominant-acting oncogene that contributes to the development of a subset of melanocytic neoplasms that do not harbor the more common melanoma-associated somatic mutations in BRAF and NRAS (PMID:19078957). Approximately 85% of uveal melanomas harbor mutually exclusive mutations of either GNA11 or GNAQ (PMID: 24713608). Identification of GNAQ codon 209 mutations may also be helpful in differentiating leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions from melanotic schwannoma (PMID: 20865267). GNAQ mutations in other types of human neoplasms appear to be quite rare (PMID: 23640210).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2776,"hugoSymbol":"GNAQ","name":"G protein subunit alpha q","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000286548","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002072.3","geneAliases":["G-ALPHA-q","GAQ","SWS"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19078957","title":"Frequent somatic mutations of GNAQ in uveal melanoma and blue naevi.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2009 Jan 29","volume":"457","issue":"7229","pages":"599-602","authors":"Van Raamsdonk CD et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature07586","link":null,"reference":"Van Raamsdonk CD et al.
