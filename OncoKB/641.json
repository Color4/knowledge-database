BLM is cell-cycle regulated and has been shown to interact with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mindbomb 1 (MIB1) and a highly conserved DNA topoisomerase 2Î²-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) (PMID: 24239288). Its helicase activity is critical for preserving fidelity of the genome, and deleterious mutations result in a strong predisposition for a broad spectrum of cancers across multiple tissue types, generally characterized as highly aggressive and occurring early in life. Inherited mutations within BLM cause the rare genetic disorder, Bloom syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe chromosomal instability and increased cancer risk (PMID: 17407155). Heterozygous deleterious mutations in BLM have been associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (PMID: 23028338) and colorectal cancers (PMID: 26358404), albeit with a moderate-to-low penetrance for the latter.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":641,"hugoSymbol":"BLM","name":"Bloom syndrome RecQ like helicase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000355112","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000057.2","geneAliases":["BS","RECQL3","RECQ2","RECQL2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"23028338","title":"Exome sequencing identifies rare deleterious mutations in DNA repair genes FANCC and BLM as potential breast cancer susceptibility alleles.","journal":"PLoS genetics","pubDate":"2012 Sep","volume":"8","issue":"9","pages":"e1002894","authors":"Thompson ER et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002894","link":null,"reference":"Thompson ER et al.
