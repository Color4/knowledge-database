Poly ADP-ribose (PAR) mediates early recruitment of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex to damaged DNA sites (PMID: 25634209); the BRCA1-BRCT domains of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex are essential for its retention and functionality at these DNA damage sites or the centrosome through binding to regulatory proteins like HP1 and OLA1, respectively (PMID: 23680151). Further, BARD1 independently regulates apoptosis through its direct binding to and stabilization of p53 (PMID 11779501). Three missense mutations which disable BARD1â€™s tumor suppressor function have been observed in breast, ovarian and uterine cancers; C645R is associated with breast and ovarian cancers, V695L is associated with breast cancer and S761N is associated with breast and uterine cancers (PMID 17550235).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":580,"hugoSymbol":"BARD1","name":"BRCA1 associated RING domain 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000260947","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000465.2","geneAliases":[],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"8944023","title":"Identification of a RING protein that can interact in vivo with the BRCA1 gene product.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"1996 Dec","volume":"14","issue":"4","pages":"430-40","authors":"Wu LC et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Wu LC et al.
