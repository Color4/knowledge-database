In particular, SDHAF2 ensures appropriate incorporation of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) into the SDH complex (PMID:19628817). Mutations of glycine 78 to arginine in SDHAF2 have been associated with hereditary head and neck parangangliomas in two different studies (PMID: 20071235, 21224366). Paragangliomas associated with SDHAF2 mutations typically have a young age of onset, and do not co-occur with mutations in SDH components (e.g. SDHA). Notably, it was identified in both studies that children who inherited a maternal mutant SDHAF2 allele were not affected by disease, suggesting that parent-of-origin for the mutant allele is important in the development of the disease (PMID: 21771581).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":54949,"hugoSymbol":"SDHAF2","name":"succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000301761","curatedRefSeq":"NM_017841.2","geneAliases":["PGL2","SDH5","C11orf79"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20071235","title":"SDHAF2 mutations in familial and sporadic paraganglioma and phaeochromocytoma.","journal":"The Lancet.
