Physiologically, NCOR1 is involved in the control of metabolism and inflammation as well as embryonal development (PMID: 20084085). NCOR1 is involved in the regulation of S-phase progression and genomic stability. It does so by maintaining acetylation and methylation patterns during S phase, which are essential for DNA repair and genomic stability (PMID: 21075309). NCOR1 has previously been linked to several kinds of cancers such as leukemia, glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal as well as endometrial carcinoma and prostate cancer (PMID: 17190815, 17630505, 17694085, 17312396, 19414341, 19269830, 12441355, 16373395, 22695118). Some leukemias are caused by translocation events that pair co-repressor-interacting proteins with proteins that are not regulated by NCOR1. This results in aberrant gene repression, which in some cases can be overcome by HDAC inhibitors (PMID: 9462740). NCOR is dramatically increased in glioblastoma multiforme, which correlates with de-differentiated phenotype and progression of the tumors (PMID: 16479164, 16534112). In these cases, preclinical evidence has shown that inhibition of the NCOR1 pathway can be achieved by simultaneous administration of Retinoic Acid and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitors which led to dramatic increase in differentiation and inhibition (PMID: 17312396).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9611,"hugoSymbol":"NCOR1","name":"nuclear receptor corepressor 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000268712","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006311.3","geneAliases":["TRAC1","PPP1R109","N-CoR","hN-CoR","N-CoR1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"16479164","title":"Identification of tumor precursor cells in the brains of primates with radiation-induced de novo glioblastoma multiforme.","journal":"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","pubDate":"2006 Feb","volume":"5","issue":"4","pages":"452-6","authors":"Lubensky IA et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lubensky IA et al.
