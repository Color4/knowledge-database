[{"evidenceId":19046,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The PPP6C gene encodes the catalytic subunit of serine/threonine phosphatase 6 (PP6) (PMID: 9143513), which integrates signaling from multiple pathways. In normal cells, PP6 regulates cell cycle progression, and hence restricts G1 to S phase progression in cancer cells (PMID: 9013334, 21187329, 10227379). PP6 plays an important role in oocyte meiosis, and loss of PP6 protein is associated with female infertility (PMID: 26349807). In addition, PP6 is involved in the homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation; it also plays an important role in inflammatory responses by IL-1 via dephosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop of TAK1 (PMID: 21451261, 17079228). PP6 has been shown to promote replication of influenza A virus (PMID: 25187537). PP6â€™s involvement in cancer has been largely established. Somatic mutations that lead to inactivation of the protein, loss of heterozygosity and nonsense mutations are observed in approximately 10% of melanomas harboring NRAS or BRAF mutations; these mutations are associated with poor prognosis (PMID: 24336958, 22842228, 24755198, 23729733, 22817889). Overexpression of PPP6C in glioblastoma is associated with worse overall survival (PMID: 25332711, 22395973); downregulation of PP6, which is dependent on miR-373, is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma and mesothelioma (PMID: 21481188, 20463022). PPP6C mutations play a role in the progression of thyroid cancer (PMID: 24718460).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5537,"hugoSymbol":"PPP6C","name":"protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000373547","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002721.4","geneAliases":["PP6","PP6C"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25187537","title":"Interactome analysis of the influenza A virus transcription/replication machinery identifies protein phosphatase 6 as a cellular factor required for efficient virus replication.","journal":"Journal of virology","pubDate":"2014 Nov","volume":"88","issue":"22","pages":"13284-99","authors":"York A et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1128/JVI.01813-14","link":null,"reference":"York A et al.
