[{"evidenceId":9491,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PIK3C3, also known as VPS34, is a class III catalytic subunit of PI3K and is important in creating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). PIK3C3 plays an important role in the maturation of autophagosomes and the transport of lysosomal enzyme precursors to lysosomes (PMID: 20562532, 22498475). PIK3C3 is also involved in mTOR signaling, which regulates autophagy in response to nutrient sensing in the cell (PMID: 24013218).
