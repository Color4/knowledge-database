The p125 subunit contains both polymerase and 3ꞌ to 5ꞌ exonuclease active sites (PMID: 7490075, 9030545). It is involved in DNA synthesis of the lagging strand during DNA replication, as well as DNA repair (PMID: 18439893, 10781066, 11027336). Reduced expression of POLD1 was shown in yeast studies to cause genomic instability, resulting from the accrual of errors during DNA replication. Furthermore, reduced expression of POLD1 was associated with fragile site instability, associated with a high frequency of chromosomal aberrations (PMID: 11003646, 18591249). Recent studies have demonstrated that levels of POLD1 protein decrease with age, resulting in reduced DNA repair capacity (PMID: 22915169, 21556771). A single codon deletion at the polymerase-active site of POLD1 and a missense mutation in the exonuclease domain are responsible for the distinct multisystem disorder characterized by subcutaneous lipodystrophy, deafness, mandibular hypoplasia and hypogonadism in males (PMID: 23770608, 25131834). Heterozygous germline mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 predispose individuals to colorectal and endometrial cancers (PMID: 23263490, 24501277, 23528559, 26133394). Associations between POLD1 variants and risk of breast cancer have been shown in several studies (PMID: 15113441, 25023197, 16685647).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-05","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5424,"hugoSymbol":"POLD1","name":"polymerase (DNA) delta 1, catalytic subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000440232","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002691.3","geneAliases":["POLD","MDPL","CRCS10","CDC2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"23528559","title":"DNA polymerase ε and δ exonuclease domain mutations in endometrial cancer.","journal":"Human molecular genetics","pubDate":"2013 Jul 15","volume":"22","issue":"14","pages":"2820-8","authors":"Church DN et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddt131","link":null,"reference":"Church DN et al.
