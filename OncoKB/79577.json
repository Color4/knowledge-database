[{"evidenceId":19728,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CDC73 gene encodes the parafibromin protein which forms the PAF1 complex with CTR9, LEO1, RTF1, SKI8, and PAF1 (PMID: 19522828). This complex regulates transcription elongation, histone methylation and histone ubiquitination (PMID: 20178742, 12667454, 12876294). It also binds the MYC oncogene and regulates the balance between MYC target gene repression and expression (PMID: 26687678). Germline mutations are associated with familial hyperparathyroidism-hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome (PMID:12434154), while somatic mutations are found in parathyroid carcinomas (PMID: 14585940).
