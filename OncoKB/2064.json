[{"evidenceId":6731,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"ERBB2, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is aberrantly amplified and/or overexpressed in a range of human cancers, including breast, gastric/gastroesophageal and endometrial tumors (PMID:19536107). ERBB2/HER2 is unique in that it does not directly bind its own ligand. Instead, it potentiates the activity of other ligand-bound ERBB receptors such as EGFR (ERBB1) or ERBB3 by binding to them (PMID:12620236). Indeed, ERBB2 is the preferred binding partner for all ERBB receptor isoforms (PMID:10220407, 9130710) and ERBB2/ERBB3 complexes have shown high mitogenic activity through the activation of downstream oncogenic PI3K pathway (PMID: 12853564). Alternatively, ERBB2 may homodimerize and initiate intracellular mitogenic cascades including RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, SRC and STAT signaling pathways (PMID: 22785351). Approximately 17% to 30% of human breast tumors harbor ERBB2 gene amplification, which is associated with poor overall survival and time to tumor recurrence (PMID: 3798106, 23000897,9552035, 9469329). Amplified ERBB2 heterodimerizes with ERBB3 to activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and drive tumorigenesis in breast cancer (PMID:12853564, 23204226, 12124352, 18632642). ERBB2 is also amplified in about 20% of gastric or gastroesophageal cancers (PMID: 24943493, 21468131), and its overexpression is targeted by multiple available drugs (e.g., trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, lapatanib, and pertuzumab) (PMID:24799465). There is a low incidence of ERBB2 amplification in non-small cell lung, ovarian, bladder, cervical, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic and salivary duct cancers and soft tissue sarcoma, and anecdotally in cholangiocarcinoma (reviewed in PMID: 24656976). Activating ERBB2 mutations have recently been identified at lower frequency in many cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, lobular breast, bladder, gastric and endometrial cancers, with recurrent hotspot alterations in both the extracellular and kinase domains (PMID: 23000897, 23220880, 22908275). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that many of these mutations are transforming and sensitive to FDA approved ERBB targeted therapies. Clinical trials are underway in ERBB2 mutant cohorts, with some positive evidence of the efficacy of ERBB2 targeted kinase inhibitors. ERBB2 mutations in colorectal cancer often co-occur with mutations in RAS.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-07-24","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2064,"hugoSymbol":"ERBB2","name":"erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000269571","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004448.2","geneAliases":["CD340","MLN 19","TKR1","NGL","HER-2/neu","HER2","HER-2","NEU"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12853564","title":"The ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer functions as an oncogenic unit: ErbB2 requires ErbB3 to drive breast tumor cell proliferation.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2003 Jul 22","volume":"100","issue":"15","pages":"8933-8","authors":"Holbro T et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Holbro T et al.
