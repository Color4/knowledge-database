Binding of the VEGF ligand, VEGFA, to FLT1 activates pathway signaling involved in angiogenesis, cell survival, migration and invasion. The VEGF-FLT1 complex has been shown to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1,2 (ERK1,2) signaling, and thus aberrant activation promotes tumor survival (PMID: 16116481). FLT1 has also been shown to rescue tumor cells from hypoxia-induced stress (PMID: 16103078) and to regulate inflammatory response genes in macrophages associated with metastases in vivo (PMID: 26261265). Mutations and frameshift deletions within FLT1 have been observed in a variety of cancer types including intestinal, skin and stomach cancers (PMID: 19718025; cBioPortal, MSKCC).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2321,"hugoSymbol":"FLT1","name":"fms related tyrosine kinase 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000282397","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002019.4","geneAliases":["VEGFR1","VEGFR-1","FLT-1","FLT"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26261265","title":"FLT1 signaling in metastasis-associated macrophages activates an inflammatory signature that promotes breast cancer metastasis.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","pubDate":"2015 Aug 24","volume":"212","issue":"9","pages":"1433-48","authors":"Qian BZ et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1084/jem.20141555","link":null,"reference":"Qian BZ et al.
