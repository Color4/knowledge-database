Under physiologic conditions, these RAS proteins cycle between an active (GTP-bound) and an inactive (GDP-bound) state, to activate the MAPK and PI3K oncogenic pathway signaling downstream of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) (PMID: 22189424). The function of RAS enzymes is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as SOS, which enable the exchange of GDP to GTP, as well as by GTPase activating proteins, such as NF1, which increase the ability of RAS to hydrolyze GTP. Once activated, RAS mediates the regulation of cellular proliferation and other cellular functions through the activation of distinct intracellular signaling pathways, including the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Transforming mutations in KRAS are frequently found in pancreatic, colon, endometrial, ovarian and biliary cancers; almost all of these mutations result in constitutive activation of KRAS, thereby promoting cell proliferation (PMID: 21993244, 24651010). KRAS mutations occur primarily in three major hotspots, G12, G13 and Q61, the first two of which occur in the GTP-ase domain and the latter interferes with the ability of NF1 to bind and regulate KRAS (PMID: 22589270, 21993244, 24651010). Other less well-characterized mutations such as A146T/V/P and L19F have also been characterized and found to be activating albeit at lower frequencies (PMID: 20147967, 20432530, 20570890). Germline KRAS mutations are responsible for both Noonan syndrome (NS) and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome (PMID: 16474405, 16474404, 19467855, 17056636) that are associated with hyperactivated MAPK pathway, distinctive clinical characteristics and a predisposition to cancer (PMID: 19467855, 17704260).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-11","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3845,"hugoSymbol":"KRAS","name":"KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000256078","curatedRefSeq":"NM_033360.2","geneAliases":["KI-RAS","RALD","NS","RASK2","CFC2","K-RAS2B","K-RAS2A","K-RAS4B","NS3","K-RAS4A","C-K-RAS","KRAS2","KRAS1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20147967","title":"Activating K-Ras mutations outwith 'hotspot' codons in sporadic colorectal tumours - implications for personalised cancer medicine.","journal":"British journal of cancer","pubDate":"2010 Feb 16","volume":"102","issue":"4","pages":"693-703","authors":"Smith G et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605534","link":null,"reference":"Smith G et al.
