The two isoforms, BCL-XL and BCL-XS, inhibit and activate apoptosis, respectively. BCL-XL sequesters activators of apoptosis such as BID, thus blocking downstream activation of the apoptosis effector proteins, BAX and BAK, which normally control mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome C (PMID: 17115033, 20584903, 9393856). Inhibition of apoptosis by BCL-XL is overcome by caspase-mediated cleavage (PMID: 9771973, 21256112). Although the pro-apoptotic effect of BCL-XS is poorly understood, it has been shown to interact with BCL2 and BCL-XL (PMID: 10777212, 11526448). BCL2L1 is located on chromosome arm 20q which is often gained in colorectal cancers, and although it is not considered a driver of tumorigenesis, its inhibition by small molecules is being explored as a therapeutic target (PMID: 22009326, 26134786, 25313317, 26401016, 23824742).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":598,"hugoSymbol":"BCL2L1","name":"BCL2 like 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000307677","curatedRefSeq":"NM_138578.1","geneAliases":["BCLX","BCL2L","Bcl-X","BCL-XL/S","PPP1R52"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"10777212","title":"Bcl-xS and Bax induce different apoptotic pathways in PC12 cells.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2000 Mar 30","volume":"19","issue":"14","pages":"1783-93","authors":"Lindenboim L et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lindenboim L et al.
