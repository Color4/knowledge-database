Upregulation of CARD11 by protein kinase C (PKC) leads to a conformational change of the protein and formation of the CBM complex, resulting in activation of NF-ĸB through the IĸB kinase (PMID: 26260210, 26212909). In mouse B-cells, CARD11 is a molecular switch defining either the occurrence of activation-induced cell death or proliferation and plasmablast differentiation (PMID: 23027925). CARD11 is an oncogene, and constitutive activation of the CBM complex is a common feature of B- and T-cell malignancies, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma where gain-of-function mutations in CARD11 have been identified (PMID: 18323416).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":84433,"hugoSymbol":"CARD11","name":"caspase recruitment domain family member 11","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000396946","curatedRefSeq":"NM_032415.4","geneAliases":["CARMA1","IMD11","BENTA","BIMP3","PPBL"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26260210","title":"TCR signaling to NF-κB and mTORC1: Expanding roles of the CARMA1 complex.","journal":"Molecular immunology","pubDate":"2015 Dec","volume":"68","issue":"2 Pt C","pages":"546-57","authors":"Shi JH et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2015.07.024","link":null,"reference":"Shi JH et al.
