TCEB1 is also part of the elongin BC complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and includes the Von-Hippel Landau (VHL) tumor suppressor, TCEB2 (elongin B), CUL2 or CUL5 and RBX1 (PMID: 25298778). Under normoxic conditions, this complex targets the hypoxia inducible factor, HIF1A, for ubiquitination and degradation, thus preventing a hypoxic response (PMID: 23797736). However, dysregulation of this complex, including inactivation of VHL or TCEB1, can lead to HIF1A accumulation and a pseudohypoxic response, even under normoxic conditions (PMID: 25298778). TCEB1-mutated renal carcinomas are molecularly distinct from conventional clear cell renal cell carcinomas, and lack both VHL mutations and chromosome 3p loss (PMID: 25676555, 23797736).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6921,"hugoSymbol":"TCEB1","name":"transcription elongation factor B subunit 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000284811","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005648.3","geneAliases":["SIII","eloC"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25676555","title":"TCEB1-mutated renal cell carcinoma: a distinct genomic and morphological subtype.","journal":"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc","pubDate":"2015 Jun","volume":"28","issue":"6","pages":"845-853","authors":"Hakimi AA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2015.6","link":null,"reference":"Hakimi AA et al.
