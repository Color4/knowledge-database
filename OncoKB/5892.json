[{"evidenceId":10360,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RAD51D (RAD51 paralog D, also known as RAD51L3) is a member of the family of RAD51 proteins, which function in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) (PMID:20813759, 15141025, 16331887) and telomere maintenance (PMID: 15109494). Although poorly characterized, biochemical studies show RAD51D forms a complex with three other RAD51 paralogs: XRCC2, RAD51B and RAD51C (known as the BCDX2 complex) (PMID: 10871607, 11751635, 16236763); this complex plays a role in the early stages of HR, prior to recruitment of RAD51 to damaged DNA foci (PMID: 11751635, 21821141). RAD51D also interacts with DNA binding and replication proteins including SFPQ, NONO, mini chromosome maintenance (MCM)2 and DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2 (PMID: 19658102). Absence of RAD51L3 leads to early embryonic lethality in homozygote mouse models, most likely from cell cycle perturbation or impaired DNA repair (PMID: 10705376, 20133210), while RAD51D deficient cells develop spontaneous chromosomal aberrations, show G2 arrest and are sensitive to 6-thioguanine (6-thioG) agents (PMID: 11283264,21205838, 15781618). Missense mutations in RAD1L1 have been detected in patients with breast cancer, where genetic alterations leading to loss of RAD1L3 have been implicated in cellular proliferation and chemoresistance (PMID: 19033885, 15170666). Germline mutations in RAD51D confer increased risk for ovarian cancer (PMID: 21822267, 23372765).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5892,"hugoSymbol":"RAD51D","name":"RAD51 paralog D","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000335858","curatedRefSeq":"NM_133629.2","geneAliases":["BROVCA4","R51H3","TRAD","RAD51L3"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"19658102","title":"The interaction profile of homologous recombination repair proteins RAD51C, RAD51D and XRCC2 as determined by proteomic analysis.","journal":"Proteomics","pubDate":"2009 Aug","volume":"9","issue":"16","pages":"4071-86","authors":"Rajesh C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1002/pmic.200800977","link":null,"reference":"Rajesh C et al.
