[{"evidenceId":17840,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"INPP4B is a lipid inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase that has a role in negatively regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The primary function of INPP4B is to selectively hydrolyze the position 4 phosphate group on the inositol ring, converting PI(3,4)P2 to PI(3)P (PMID: 24069021). INPP4B has been implicated in the suppression of cell proliferation, cell motility and tumor growth in mice via control of the PI3K/AKT pathway (PMID: 21127264, 19325558, 24069021). INPP4B loss of heterozygosity has been identified in breast and ovarian cancer patients, suggesting that INPP4B functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 19647222, 21127264). Loss-of-function studies in breast cancer cell line and murine models demonstrate that reduced expression of INPP4B results in enhanced AKT expression, cell invasiveness, and tumor progression (PMID: 19647222). Loss of INPP4B expression is observed in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and correlates with lower overall survival (PMID 19647222).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8821,"hugoSymbol":"INPP4B","name":"inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262992","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001101669.1","geneAliases":[],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"19325558","title":"Regulation of PI(3)K/Akt signalling and cellular transformation by inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase-1.","journal":"EMBO reports","pubDate":"2009 May","volume":"10","issue":"5","pages":"487-93","authors":"Ivetac I et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/embor.2009.28","link":null,"reference":"Ivetac I et al.
