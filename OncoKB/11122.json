[{"evidenceId":2808,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The PTPRT gene encodes the enzyme receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase T, which is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) family. PTPRT contains extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains, thus constituting a receptor-like PTP with a role in cell-cell adhesion (PMID: 16973135, 16557282). Identified targets for dephosphorylation by PTPRT include cadherins E, N and VE, STAT3, PXN and BCR (PMID: 16973135, 22767509, 20133777). Mutations in PTPRT are found specifically in colon cancer but also in a wide range of other human cancers, including both solid and blood tumors. PTPRT is characterized as a tumor suppressor, as PTPRT mutations in cancer are predominantly loss of function, and PTPRT knock-out mice are hypersensitive to AOM (azoxymethane)-induced colon cancer (PMID: 17223850, 25982282, 15155950, 21517784).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":11122,"hugoSymbol":"PTPRT","name":"protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type T","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000373198","curatedRefSeq":"NM_133170.3","geneAliases":["RPTPrho"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16557282","title":"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases and cancer.","journal":"Nature reviews.
