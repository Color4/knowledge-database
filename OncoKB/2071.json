[{"evidenceId":17923,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"ERCC3 (also known as XPB) encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase which is an essential component of the transcription factor II H(TFIIH) complex. ERCC3 functions to unwind the DNA double helix which is required as part of the nucleotide-excision repair (NER) pathway (PMID: 21571596, 8465201, 8107888, 21571596). The TFIIH transcriptional complex also requires activity of ERCC3 for initiation of transcription (PMID: 8152490, 7613092, 8166891). Hereditary ERCC3 mutations are found in individuals with Cockayne's syndrome and trichothiodystrophy (PMID: 4811796, 8408834, 8304337,16947863, 9012405, 23562818). Mutations in ERCC3, likely impairing transcriptional function, have been identified in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum B, a condition resulting in sensitivity to sunlight and increased skin-cancer risk (PMID: 10064601). Loss-of-function ERCC3 truncating mutations have been associated with breast cancer risk, likely due to defects in DNA repair pathways (PMID: 24508195, 27655433).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2071,"hugoSymbol":"ERCC3","name":"ERCC excision repair 3, TFIIH core complex helicase subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000285398","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000122.1","geneAliases":["GTF2H","BTF2","TFIIH","TTD2","RAD25","XPB"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"8107888","title":"Transcription factor b (TFIIH) is required during nucleotide-excision repair in yeast.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"1994 Mar 3","volume":"368","issue":"6466","pages":"74-6","authors":"Wang Z et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Wang Z et al.
