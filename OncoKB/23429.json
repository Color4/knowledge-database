RYBP is part of the Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and interacts directly with RING1, RNF2, and YY1, to mediate H2A ubiquitylation at specific polycomb target sites to repress these genes (PMID: 22325148). It has been show to play an important role in development and stem cell programming through its role in transcriptional repression (PMID: 10369680). RYBP also has polycomb-independent roles, and can act as a tumor suppressor through interaction with MDM2 and subsequent stabilization of TP53 (PMID: 19098711). The genetic locus of RYBP is frequently deleted in prostate cancers and loss of RYBP expression has been detected in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer and is associated with poor outcome (PMID: 20579941, 25344099, 26404750).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-15","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":23429,"hugoSymbol":"RYBP","name":"RING1 and YY1 binding protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000477973","curatedRefSeq":"NM_012234.5","geneAliases":["APAP-1","DEDAF","YEAF1","AAP1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"10369680","title":"RYBP, a new repressor protein that interacts with components of the mammalian Polycomb complex, and with the transcription factor YY1.","journal":"The EMBO journal","pubDate":"1999 Jun 15","volume":"18","issue":"12","pages":"3404-18","authors":"García E et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"García E et al.
