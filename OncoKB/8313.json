Negative regulation of beta-catenin by the complex in the absence of a extracellular stimulus is central to Wnt signaling (PMID: 20128690, 23169527). In the complex, AXIN2 and AXIN1 provide scaffolding and bind to the tumor suppressor, APC (PMID: 14600025) enabling CTNNB1 destruction (PMID: 9734785). AXIN2 is involved in the TGFβ and SAPK pathways (PMID: 15735151). As part of the AXIN-HIPK2-TP53 complex, the protein also plays a role in the control of cell growth, apoptosis and development (PMID: 15526030). Somatic mutations in this gene have been associated with colorectal cancer (PMID: 11017067). Germline mutations in AXIN2 have been associated with gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers (PMID: 25236910, 21541676) as well as familial tooth agenesis and predisposition to colorectal cancer (PMID: 15042511). No drugs targeting the Wnt pathway have yet been approved (PMID: 24981364). AXIN2 expression has been shown to predict prostate cancer recurrence (PMID: 26771938).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8313,"hugoSymbol":"AXIN2","name":"axin 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000307078","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004655.3","geneAliases":["AXIL","ODCRCS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"15042511","title":"Mutations in AXIN2 cause familial tooth agenesis and predispose to colorectal cancer.","journal":"American journal of human genetics","pubDate":"2004 May","volume":"74","issue":"5","pages":"1043-50","authors":"Lammi L et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lammi L et al.
