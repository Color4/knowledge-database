[{"evidenceId":8046,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The FGFR3 gene encodes the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3, a membrane spanning tyrosine kinases receptor which belongs to the FGFR family (FGFR1-4). Binding of the FGFR3 protein by its cognate ligands, the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), results in a receptor dimerization, and consequent activation of downstream pathways that regulate proliferation, differentiation, cell migration, and apoptosis (PMID: 7542215, 20094046). Alternative splicing events in the FGFR3 gene generate two isoforms, FGFR3b and FGFR3c, which have unique tissue expression patterns and ligand-binding specificity (PMID: 8663044, 7512569). A specific t(4;14) translocation, which is observed in approximately 15% of patients with multiple myeloma, results in constitutive expression of FGFR3 (PMID: 17107900). Additionally, activating point mutations in FGFR3 have been observed in up to 70% of bladder cancers. Of those, the mutations leading to S249C substitution in FGFR3 account for 69% of all mutations (PMID: 11395371, 12743143, 16338952).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2261,"hugoSymbol":"FGFR3","name":"fibroblast growth factor receptor 3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000260795","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000142.4","geneAliases":["JTK4","HSFGFR3EX","ACH","CEK2","CD333"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20094046","title":"Fibroblast growth factor signalling: from development to cancer.","journal":"Nature reviews.
