[{"evidenceId":17848,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"ID3 (Inhibitor for DNA binding 3) is a protein that binds basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors and inhibits their activity. ID3 proteins form heterodimers with tissue-specific HLH proteins, such as E proteins, that disrupt their binding to DNA (PMID: 2000388, 2156629, 16034366). ID3 can regulate cell differentiation, cell proliferation, cell invasiveness and angiogenesis (PMID: 8197168, 11840325, 11840326, 10197587, 11058077, 9528806, 16034366). Loss of ID3 expression in mice results in defects in B-cell proliferation and the development of lymphomas (PMID: 10454544). Loss-of-function mutations in ID3 are common in Burkitt's lymphoma and result in disruption of ID3 transcriptional activity (PMID: 23143595). ID3 is also overexpressed in various tumors, with both growth-enhancing and growth-suppressing effects (PMID: 26135667, 26384138, 10537105, 11689883, 11085505) suggesting that ID3 appears to have context-dependent oncogenic and tumor suppressor functions in cancer.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3399,"hugoSymbol":"ID3","name":"inhibitor of DNA binding 3, HLH protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000374561","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002167.4","geneAliases":["HEIR-1","bHLHb25"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"2000388","title":"An Id-related helix-loop-helix protein encoded by a growth factor-inducible gene.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"1991 Mar 1","volume":"88","issue":"5","pages":"1815-9","authors":"Christy BA et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Christy BA et al.
