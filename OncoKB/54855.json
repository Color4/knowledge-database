[{"evidenceId":17898,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"FAM46C is a protein that belongs to the group XXV nucleotidyltransferase superfamily and functions as a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase (PMID: 27060136). FAM46C expression has been shown to regulate cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and regulation of RAS/MAPK signaling (PMID: 28341836). Loss-of-function FAM46C mutations and deletions have been identified in multiple myeloma, suggesting that FAM46C is a tumor suppressor (PMID: 21430775, 26282654, 20616218, 24434212). Mutations or deletions in FAM46C are associated with reduced overall survival in patients with multiple myleoma (PMID: 21994415). Rearrangements between MYC and FAM46C have also been found in patients with multiple myeloma (PMID: 24632883).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":54855,"hugoSymbol":"FAM46C","name":"family with sequence similarity 46 member C","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000369448","curatedRefSeq":"NM_017709.3","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21994415","title":"Mapping of chromosome 1p deletions in myeloma identifies FAM46C at 1p12 and CDKN2C at 1p32.3 as being genes in regions associated with adverse survival.","journal":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","pubDate":"2011 Dec 15","volume":"17","issue":"24","pages":"7776-84","authors":"Boyd KD et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1791","link":null,"reference":"Boyd KD et al.
