The Abraxas-BRCA1 complex plays an important role in tumor suppression. FAM175A copy loss and somatic mutations have been observed in multiple human cancers, including endometrial, colon, lung, liver, kidney cancers, and in leukemia, with the highest mutation rate found in endometrial cancer (2.5%) (PMID: 25066119). A novel germ line mutation in Abraxas which abrogates BRCA1-dependent DNA repair function has been identified and shown to increases familial breast cancer susceptibility (PMID: 22357538).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":84142,"hugoSymbol":"FAM175A","name":"family with sequence similarity 175 member A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000321945","curatedRefSeq":"NM_139076.2","geneAliases":["ABRA1","CCDC98"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22357538","title":"Breast cancer-associated Abraxas mutation disrupts nuclear localization and DNA damage response functions.","journal":"Science translational medicine","pubDate":"2012 Feb 22","volume":"4","issue":"122","pages":"122ra23","authors":"Solyom S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3003223","link":null,"reference":"Solyom S et al.
