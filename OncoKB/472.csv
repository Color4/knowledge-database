5947,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"ATM encodes Ataxia Talengiectasia Mutated (ATM), a member of the protein superfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related serine/threonine kinases (PIKKs). ATM is a tumor suppressor that initiates DNA damage checkpoint signaling after accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or after accumulation of other forms of cellular stress (PMID: 23219553). Activated ATM can phosphorylate hundreds of substrates in order to initiate and amplify the DNA damage response (PMID: 17525332) that leads to DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. In the general population, germline and sporadic mutations in ATM are found in a wide variety of tumor types. In large scale studies of solid tumors, ~5% of patient samples showed ATM aberrations leading to mutation or loss of the protein, suggesting that ATM is a potent tumor suppressor. ATM is named after the autosomal recessive disorder Ataxia talengiectasia (A-T), which is caused by a variety of mutations in the ATM gene that render the protein nonfunctional. In addition to a variety of neurologic conditions, lung and skin disorders and immunodeficiency, patients with A-T are also pre-disposed to a wide variety of cancers, particularly childhood lymphomas and leukemia and breast cancer (PMID: 21792198). Furthermore, patients with A-T show a profound sensitization to radiation, sparking considerable interest in ATM as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy (PMID: 18813293).",,2017-04-26,,472,ATM,ATM serine/threonine kinase,False,ENST00000278616,NM_000051.3,ATC,TEL1,ATE,ATDC,TELO1,AT1,ATA,True,21792198,Lymphoid tumours and breast cancer in ataxia telangiectasia; substantial protective effect of residual ATM kinase activity against childhood tumours.,British journal of cancer,2018-08-09T20:11:00,105,4,586-91,Reiman A et al,doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.266,,0001-08-09,,23219553,Competition between NBS1 and ATMIN controls ATM signaling pathway choice.,Cell reports,2017-12-27T20:12:00,2,6,1498-504,Zhang T et al,doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.11.002,,2017-12-27T05:04:00,,18813293,Ataxia-telangiectasia: from a rare disorder to a paradigm for cell signalling and cancer.,Nature reviews.
