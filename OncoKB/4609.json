MYC promotes tumorigenesis by inducing proliferation, inhibiting exit from the cell cycle, stimulating vascularization and enhancing genomic instability (PMID: 22464321,10378696,16934487,19029958). MYC becomes activated in cancers through a variety of mechanisms, including chromosomal translocations (typically associated with blood cancers, and associated with constitutive over-expression), as well as genomic amplification and overexpression (PMID: 22464321). Mutations in the MYC gene occur, but are less frequent than amplification and translocation. Mutations of known function reside near residue T58, which is a phosphorylation site on MYC critical for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the MYC protein (PMID: 10706881). The MYC gene family consists of three related genes: (1) c-MYC (herein referred to as MYC, encoded by the gene MYC), (2) N-MYC (encoded by the gene MYCN) and (3) L-MYC (encoded by the gene MYCL1) (PMID: 16934487). The MYC gene is located on at the chromosomal locus 8q24, and contains several distinct structural domains, including) an N-terminus transcriptional activation domain, a central portion and a C-terminus DNA-binding domain containing a basis helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif. Within these domains are five \"Myc-boxes,\" regions which are highly conserved in MYC family proteins across multiple species (PMID: 19029958).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4609,"hugoSymbol":"MYC","name":"v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000377970","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002467.4","geneAliases":["c-Myc","MYCC","MRTL","bHLHe39"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19029958","title":"Reflecting on 25 years with MYC.","journal":"Nature reviews.
