GATA3 regulation has cell-type specific effects on gene expression and is expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues (PMID: 12923059, 17129787, 19112489). Haploinsufficiency of GATA3 results in the autosomal dominant HDR (hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renaldysplasia) syndrome, also known as Barakat syndrome (PMID: 10935639). GATA3 expression is essential in the development of normal mammary epithelium in mice and humans and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of luminal breast cancer (reviewed in PMID: 21779441, 19798694). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function GATA3 mutations have been identified in breast cancer, suggesting that in different contexts GATA3 may function as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor (PMID: 27588951).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2625,"hugoSymbol":"GATA3","name":"GATA binding protein 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000346208","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002051.2","geneAliases":["HDR","HDRS"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17129787","title":"GATA-3 maintains the differentiation of the luminal cell fate in the mammary gland.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"2006 Dec 1","volume":"127","issue":"5","pages":"1041-55","authors":"Kouros-Mehr H et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Kouros-Mehr H et al.
