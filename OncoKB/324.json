The main tumor suppressive role of APC is in its ability to modulate intracellular levels of β-catenin (PMID: 11978510). The ability of APC to exit the nucleus is essential for its tumor suppressor function (PMID: 10984057). When the activity of APC is lost, there is an aberrant increase in WNT-pathway activation, often leading to hyperplasia and eventually tumor progression (PMID: 8259511). Interestingly, there appears to be a threshold of APC expression required to suppress tumor formation, and this level is finely balanced, as there is an optimal level of β-catenin required for tumorigenesis (PMID: 11743581). Mutations in the APC gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (PMID: 1651174, 1651562), a disease in which 95% of people progress to get colorectal cancer (PMID: 1528264). Germline mutations in APC are also responsible for the development of a number of related diseases, including Turcot Syndrome, Gardner Syndrome and Flat Adenoma Syndrome (PMID: 8593545). APC mutations, much like those seen in FAS, have been observed in 50-80% of sporadic colorectal cancers (PMID: 17143297). Mutations are also observed in prostate, stomach, skin, uterine, breast, lung, bladder and head and neck cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, April 2015). The majority of APC mutations are truncating, and most APC somatic mutations are located within the protein's mutation cluster region (MCR), important for β-catenin binding (PMID: 10784639, 1338904).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-24","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":324,"hugoSymbol":"APC","name":"APC, WNT signaling pathway regulator","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000257430","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000038.5","geneAliases":["BTPS2","DP3","PPP1R46","DP2","GS","DP2.5"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"10784639","title":"Biology of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor.","journal":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","pubDate":"2000 May","volume":"18","issue":"9","pages":"1967-79","authors":"Goss KH et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Goss KH et al.
