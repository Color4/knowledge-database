[{"evidenceId":19776,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CDC42 gene encodes a small GTPase that localizes to the plasma membrane of the cell. CDC42 can switch between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, transducing signals to a variety of downstream effectors (PMID: 21115489). CDC42 plays a role in cell polarization, chemotaxis, migration and mitosis (PMID: 14978216, 15642749, 17038317, 26689677). In cancer, CDC42 overexpression has been associated with enhanced proliferation and invasion, suggesting an oncogenic role; however, a tumor suppressor function related to cell polarity maintenance has also been observed (PMID: 21515363). Mutations and copy number alterations of CDC42 are rare events in cancer. CDC42, as well as other Rho GTPases (e.g., Ras oncoproteins), are difficult targets for pharmacological intervention, although some CDC42-specific drugs exist (PMID: 21433396).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":998,"hugoSymbol":"CDC42","name":"cell division cycle 42","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000344548","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001791.3","geneAliases":["G25K","CDC42Hs","TKS"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21115489","title":"Signaling role of Cdc42 in regulating mammalian physiology.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"2011 Jan 28","volume":"286","issue":"4","pages":"2375-81","authors":"Melendez J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1074/jbc.R110.200329","link":null,"reference":"Melendez J et al.
