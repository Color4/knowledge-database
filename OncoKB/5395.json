[{"evidenceId":10043,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PMS2 is an endonuclease that plays an essential role in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Specifically, PMS2 nicks DNA to initiate excision of a mismatched strand (PMID: 20624957). Mutations in PMS2 lead to an inability to correctly repair mismatches and insertion/deletion loops in the DNA, which results in increased tumor hypermutation and a microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) phenotype (PMID: 14871975). Germline mutations of PMS2 can cause Lynch syndrome, which predisposes to certain cancers including colon, endometrial and ovarian cancers and implicates PMS2 as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 16472587). Sporadic PMS2 mutations have also been reported in cancers from numerous tissue types (PMID: 16472587). Tumor hypermutation has been associated with response to certain immunotherapies. Specifically, pembrolizumab has been FDA approved for all MMR-deficient and MSI tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology (PMID: 25409260, 26028255).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5395,"hugoSymbol":"PMS2","name":"PMS1 homolog 2, mismatch repair system component","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000265849","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000535.5","geneAliases":["HNPCC4","PMSL2","MLH4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20624957","title":"PMS2 endonuclease activity has distinct biological functions and is essential for genome maintenance.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2010 Jul 27","volume":"107","issue":"30","pages":"13384-9","authors":"van Oers JM et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.1008589107","link":null,"reference":"van Oers JM et al.
