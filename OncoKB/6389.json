[{"evidenceId":19009,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The SDHA (Succinate dehydrogenase A) gene encodes a tumor suppressor and one of the four components of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, which localizes to the inner membrane of mitochondria (PMID: 16892081, 21771581). Succinate dehydrogenase (also called Complex II) is a critical enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which couples the oxidation of succinate to fumarate and transfers electrons directly to the ubiquinone pool. SDHA and other SDH complex family members function as tumor suppressors; loss of function mutations in these genes have been shown to stabilize HIF, thus leading to a hypoxic state that promotes tumorigenesis (PMID: 20484225,16892081, 11605159, 16103922, 16195397 ). Mutation of components of the SDH complex lead to accumulation of the succinate, which can competitively inhibit the action of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent histone and DNA demethylases in a variety of cancers (PMID: 23707781, 22974104,16892081). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the SDH genes, including SDHA, cause hereditary paraganglioma and phaeochromocytoma (PMID: 21771581). Mutations in SDH genes have also been linked to gastrointestinal tumors (PMID: 23730622).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6389,"hugoSymbol":"SDHA","name":"succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000264932","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004168.2","geneAliases":["PGL5","CMD1GG","SDHF","FP","SDH1","SDH2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"23730622","title":"Succinate dehydrogenase deficiency in pediatric and adult gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","journal":"Frontiers in oncology","pubDate":"2013","volume":"3","issue":"","pages":"117","authors":"Belinsky MG et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00117","link":null,"reference":"Belinsky MG et al.
