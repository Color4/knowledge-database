MTOR activity is mediated through two distinct multi-protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (PMID: 22500797, 21157483) which are composed of common subunits (mTOR, mLST8, DEPTOR) (PMID: 12718876, 19446321) and uniquely defined by specific subunits. mTORC1 is defined by the PRAS40 and RAPTOR subunits (PMID: 12150926, 12150925, 17386266, 17510057), while mTORC2 is defined by RICTOR, mSIN1 and PROTOR1/2 (PMID: 15268862, 15718470, 16919458). The two best characterized downstream targets of mTORC1, S6K and 4EBP1, dictate the rate of protein synthesis, nutrient response and many additional features required for rapid tumor growth (PMID: 15314020). Consequently, inhibition of mTORC1 has been therapeutically exploited across a variety of malignancies. mTORC2 coordinates with PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate AKT. mTORC2 is known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression and cellular survival (PMID: 18566586). Missense mutations of the MTOR gene occur in many tumors, notably in approximately 6% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 7.5% of lung adenocarcinomas, 5% of endometrial carcinomas and 4% of colon and rectal carcinomas (PMID: 24132290). Furthermore, various mTOR mutations have been characterized that cause increased MTOR pathway activation and increased sensitivity to rapamycin (PMID: 24631838, 24625776). Several case reports in the literature have reported extreme durable responses to rapamycin-analogue (rapalogue) therapies in patients with heavily pre-treated metastatic cancer and activating mTOR mutations (PMID: 24622468, 24625776). Additionally, two rapalogue mTOR inhibitors, everolimus and temsirolimus, are FDA-approved for the treatment of human cancer, and numerous compounds with alternative mechanisms of action are in various stages of development (PMID: 26299952).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2475,"hugoSymbol":"MTOR","name":"mechanistic target of rapamycin","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000361445","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004958.3","geneAliases":["FRAP1","RAFT1","FRAP2","FRAP","SKS","RAPT1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15268862","title":"Rictor, a novel binding partner of mTOR, defines a rapamycin-insensitive and raptor-independent pathway that regulates the cytoskeleton.","journal":"Current biology : CB","pubDate":"2004 Jul 27","volume":"14","issue":"14","pages":"1296-302","authors":"Sarbassov DD et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sarbassov DD et al.
