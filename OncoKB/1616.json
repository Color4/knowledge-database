[{"evidenceId":17734,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The death domain-associated protein (Daxx) was originally cloned as a CD95 (FAS)-interacting protein and modulator of FAS-induced cell death (PMID: 16406523, 9215629). Daxx accumulates in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm; in the nucleus, Daxx is found associated with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear body and with a-thalassemia/- mental retardation syndrome protein (ATRX)-positive heterochromatic regions. In the cytoplasm, Daxx has been reported to interact with various proteins involved in cell death regulation. The proteins encoded by ATRX and DAXX interact with one another and play multiple cellular roles, including chromatin remodeling at telomeres, where they are required for the incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 (PMID:12953102, 21047901, 20651253, 21029860). 43% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) had mutations in genes encoding either of DAXX and ATRX (PMID: 21252315).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-07-13","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1616,"hugoSymbol":"DAXX","name":"death-domain associated protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000374542","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001141970.1","geneAliases":["BING2","DAP6","EAP1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"21047901","title":"HIRA and Daxx constitute two independent histone H3.3-containing predeposition complexes.","journal":"Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology","pubDate":"2010","volume":"75","issue":"","pages":"27-34","authors":"Elsaesser SJ et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1101/sqb.2010.75.008","link":null,"reference":"Elsaesser SJ et al.
