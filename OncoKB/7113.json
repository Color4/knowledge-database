Although its role in normal epithelial cells is not well understood, TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in the prostate epithelium and is an androgen responsive gene (PMID:11245484). TMPRSS2 can cleave components of the tumor microenvironment, such as pro-HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) to promote invasion and metastasis (PMID: 25122198). TMPRSS2 is recurrently fused to ETS-family transcription factors in about 50% of primary prostate cancers, including the TMPRSS2-ERG and TMPRSS2-ETV1 fusions, resulting in overexpression of these ETS family members (PMID: 16254181). TMPRSS2 gene fusions in prostate cancer often occur in the setting of PTEN loss and subsequent PI3-kinase pathway activation (PMID:19396168,19396167). In these cancers, ETS transcription factors modify the chromatin landscape of prostate cancer cells, allowing for increased androgen receptor (AR) binding and priming prostate cancer initiation in response to PTEN loss (PMID: 23817021, 28783165).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7113,"hugoSymbol":"TMPRSS2","name":"transmembrane protease, serine 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000398585","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001135099.1","geneAliases":["PP9284","PRSS10"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11245484","title":"Catalytic cleavage of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 protease results in its secretion by prostate and prostate cancer epithelia.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2001 Feb 15","volume":"61","issue":"4","pages":"1686-92","authors":"Afar DE et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Afar DE et al.
