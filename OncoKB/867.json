[{"evidenceId":7738,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CBL gene encodes a proto-oncogene and E3 ubiquitin-ligase involved in the degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases (PMID: 11283727, 23085373). The CBL protein has several evolutionary conserved regions, including a tyrosine kinase binding domain, a zinc-finger binding RING domain and a short linker sequence connecting the tyrosine kinase binding and RING domains (PMID: 11283727). Together, these regions form a structure for binding to an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, which is essential for the E3 activity of CBL (PMID: 23085373). CBL family E3 ligases selectively and negatively regulate activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR (PMID: 23085373), PDGFR (PMID: 11283727), CSF-1R (PMID: 11283727), MET (PMID: 24384534), FLT3 (PMID: 17446348), through ubiquitylation that targets these proteins for degradation by the proteosome (PMID: 11283727). In addition to receptor tyrosine kinase regulation, CBL-b is also involved in T cell activation and peripheral T cell tolerance (PMID: 24875217, 17704644, 11283727).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-27","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":867,"hugoSymbol":"CBL","name":"Cbl proto-oncogene","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000264033","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005188.3","geneAliases":["NSLL","RNF55","C-CBL","CBL2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"17704644","title":"The ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl-b in T cells tolerance and tumor immunity.","journal":"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","pubDate":"2007 Oct 15","volume":"6","issue":"20","pages":"2478-85","authors":"Loeser S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Loeser S et al.
