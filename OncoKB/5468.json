[{"evidenceId":18678,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PPARG encodes the PeroxisomeProliferator-Activated Receptor- gamma (PPAR- γ) subfamily of nuclear receptors.PPAR-γ forms a heterodimer with Retinoid X Receptor-α in response to peroxisomeproliferators such as clofibric acid or to RXR-α agonists such as 9-cisretinoic acid, and activates the expression of various genes involved in theregulation of adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, atherogenesis, inflammation and tumor susceptibility(PMID: 1324435, 8536636). Chromosomal translocation (2;3)(q13;p25) resulting ina fusion between DNA binding domains of thyroid transcription factor Paired boxgene 8 (PAX8) and PPAR- γ1 has been identified in a subset of thyroidfollicular carcinomas (PMID: 10958784). PAX8-PPAR-γ behaveslike an oncoprotein, and its transforming properties can be attributed at leastin part to a dominant negative inhibition of wildtype PPAR-γ (PMID: 15077183).Ligands that activate PPAR-γ, typically thiazolidinediones, are known tosensitize a wide array of cancer cells to death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis,owing to de novo expression of proteins involved in regulating the cell cycleand cell survival/death, and also act as inhibitors of angiogenesis (PMID: 18615184,15041792). On the contrary, PPAR-γ agonists have also been reported to increase thefrequency and size of colon tumors in APCMin/+ mouse models of colon cancer(PMID: 9734399, 9734400).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5468,"hugoSymbol":"PPARG","name":"peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000287820","curatedRefSeq":"NM_015869.4","geneAliases":["PPARG1","PPARG2","CIMT1","GLM1","PPARgamma","NR1C3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"10958784","title":"PAX8-PPARgamma1 fusion oncogene in human thyroid carcinoma [corrected].","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2000 Aug 25","volume":"289","issue":"5483","pages":"1357-60","authors":"Kroll TG et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Kroll TG et al.
