[{"evidenceId":19504,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"FLCN encodes for the tumor suppressor gene Folliculin. It acts as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagC/D GTPase proteins involved in amino acid sensing and signaling to mTORC1 (PMID:24095279). Varying cellular processes have been implicated with its function including regulation of oxidative metabolism at the mitochondria, mitochondrial biogeneis, and autophagy (PMID:23150719, 24762438, 25126726). Mutations can activate the mTOR pathway and AKT signaling (PMID:19850877, 24908670). FLCN mutations are found in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome with characterized by fibrofolliculomas, pneumothorax, and renal cell carcinomas (PMID: 22146830,15956655).
