[{"evidenceId":10328,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ARAF gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase and component of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase signaling pathway. ARAF is a member of the RAF kinase family, which also includes BRAF and CRAF (PMID: 17555829). ARAF is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest physiological levels found in the urogenital organs (PMID: 10768864). Upon activation by RAS proteins, ARAF forms dimers with BRAF and CRAF, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of MEK and subsequently ERK. This signaling cascade ultimately leads to increased cell growth and proliferation (PMID: 21779496). ARAF mutations are found in 11% of cholangiocarcinomas and in lower frequencies in other cancers including lung, uterine and stomach carcinoma (PMID: 25608663; cBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2016). The most common oncogenic ARAF mutation is S214, which impairs a phosphorylation site that negatively regulates RAS binding and ARAF activation, leading to hyperactivity of the MAP-kinase signaling pathway (PMID: 24569458).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":369,"hugoSymbol":"ARAF","name":"A-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000377045","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001654.4","geneAliases":["ARAF1","A-RAF","RAFA1","PKS2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17555829","title":"Raf kinases: function, regulation and role in human cancer.","journal":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","pubDate":"2007 Aug","volume":"1773","issue":"8","pages":"1196-212","authors":"Leicht DT et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Leicht DT et al.
