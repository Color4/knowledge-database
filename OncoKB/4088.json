Members in the SMAD family of proteins have an N-terminal MH1 and a C-terminal MH2 domain, the former important for DNA binding and the latter for binding to regulators and effectors, including the TGFß receptors and transcription cofactors (PMID: 12821112, 25935112). Along with SMADs 1,2,5,8/9, SMAD3 is classified as a receptor-regulated-SMAD (R-SMAD) for which activation requires the phosphorylation of two serine residues in the MH2 domain by a membrane receptor serine kinase. In the case of SMAD2 and SMAD3, activation is mediated by the binding of the TGFß superfamily of cytokines (e.g. TGFß1, TGFß2, TGFß3, activin and nodal) to receptor kinases (PMID: 25935112, 9759503). Phosphorylation allows SMAD3 to form a heterotrimer together with another R-SMAD and SMAD4 which functions to induce target gene expression (PMID: 25935112). The specificity of TGFß target gene expression depends on the availability of transcriptional co-activators and chromatin accessibility (PMID: 22992590). The contextual nature TGFß-dependent transcription allows the TGFß pathway to suppress tumorigenesis in premalignant states and promote invasiveness and metastasis during cancer progression (PMID: 22992590, 18662538, 20495575, 21217753, 21778426, 22167769). SMAD3 mutations are found in hereditary syndromes in the Loeys-Dietz phenotypic series of diseases (PMID: 22167769, 21217753, 21778426). Deregulation of TGFß signaling is a common feature of colorectal cancer, which may occur via loss-of-function mutations and focal deletion of SMAD3, in accordance with studies in transgenic mice (PMID: 22810696, 23139211, 9753318, 16959974). SMAD3 alterations, although infrequent, have been observed in various other tumor types (PMID: 16959974, 14647420, 21771027, 15295048, 12161532).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4088,"hugoSymbol":"SMAD3","name":"SMAD family member 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000327367","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005902.3","geneAliases":["MADH3","LDS1C","HSPC193","LDS3","HsT17436","JV15-2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"21778426","title":"Exome sequencing identifies SMAD3 mutations as a cause of familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection with intracranial and other arterial aneurysms.","journal":"Circulation research","pubDate":"2011 Sep 2","volume":"109","issue":"6","pages":"680-6","authors":"Regalado ES et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.248161","link":null,"reference":"Regalado ES et al.
