EIF1AX triggers the transfer of the methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi)-eIF2-GTP ternary complex to the 40S ribosomal subunit (PMID: 16193068). This complex creates the 43S pre-initiation complex which binds to the capped 5'-end of mRNA and subsequently reads the mRNA until it finds the first AUG codon (PMID: 23873042). Mutations in EIF1AX have been observed in uveal melanomas with disomy 3 and are associated with an increased risk of metastasis (PMID: 23793026, 24970262). EIF1AX mutations have also been identified in some cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma and leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms (PMID: 25417114, 26769193). Alterations of the EIF1AX gene are predominantly missense mutations that alter the protein's highly conserved N-terminal which is critical for the initiation of protein translation, suggesting that EIF1AX acts as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 23793026, 16193068, 24970262).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1964,"hugoSymbol":"EIF1AX","name":"eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, X-linked","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000379607","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001412.3","geneAliases":["EIF1AP1","eIF-4C","eIF-1A","EIF1A","EIF4C"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16193068","title":"The eIF1A C-terminal domain promotes initiation complex assembly, scanning and AUG selection in vivo.","journal":"The EMBO journal","pubDate":"2005 Oct 19","volume":"24","issue":"20","pages":"3588-601","authors":"Fekete CA et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Fekete CA et al.
