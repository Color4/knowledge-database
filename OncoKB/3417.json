IDH1 utilizes NADP(+) as an electron acceptor and it is predominantly expressed in the cytosol and peroxisomes, playing a role in the cytoplasmic production of NADPH. Cancer-associated mutations in the catalytic site of IDH1 confer a gain-of-function of neomorphic enzymatic activity, allowing the mutant enzyme to convert α-KG to the “oncometabolite” D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (PMID: 20171147). 2-HG promotes tumor development by inhibiting a variety of enzymes that require α-KG as a substrate, including enzymes involved in DNA demethylation, histone demethylation, adaptation to hypoxia and collagen maturation. IDH1 mutations have been identified in glioma, cholangiocarcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) among others (PMID: 19657110, 23630074).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-02","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3417,"hugoSymbol":"IDH1","name":"isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 1, cytosolic","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000345146","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005896.2","geneAliases":["IDP","HEL-216","IDH","IDPC","IDCD","HEL-S-26","PICD"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19657110","title":"Recurring mutations found by sequencing an acute myeloid leukemia genome.","journal":"The New England journal of medicine","pubDate":"2009 Sep 10","volume":"361","issue":"11","pages":"1058-66","authors":"Mardis ER et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0903840","link":null,"reference":"Mardis ER et al.
