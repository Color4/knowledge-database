H1 histone proteins bind to linker DNA between nucleosomes and influences higher order chromatin structure. The histone H1 family comprises eleven members, each one transcribed by its own gene. A number of studies have shown that H1 levels are altered in cancer and variant-specific changes can be observed in different tumor types. Although H1 variants share significant homology in their globular DNA-binding domain, they are more divergent in their C- and N-terminal tails, and evidence suggests that they may have distinct functions in the nucleus. The so-called “main” H1 variants, which include HIST1H1A (encoding H1.1), HIST1H1B (H1.5), HIST1H1C (H1.2), HIST1H1D (H1.3), HIST1H1E (H1.4) HIST1H1T (H1.6), are mainly transcribed in S-phase and therefore expressed at high levels only in dividing cells (PMID: 18208346, 26474902, 26386351). HIST1H1C mutations have been identified in follicular lymphoma and impair HIST1H1C binding to DNA, likely impacting chromatin structure and gene expression (PMID: 24362818).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3006,"hugoSymbol":"HIST1H1C","name":"histone cluster 1, H1c","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000343677","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005319.3","geneAliases":["H1s-1","H1F2","H1C","H1.2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18208346","title":"The histone H1 family: specific members, specific functions?","journal":"Biological chemistry","pubDate":"2008 Apr","volume":"389","issue":"4","pages":"333-43","authors":"Izzo A et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1515/BC.2008.037","link":null,"reference":"Izzo A et al.
