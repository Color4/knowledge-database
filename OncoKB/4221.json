Menin interacts with multiple proteins that play critical roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, including JunD, Smad, and activator of S-phase kinase (PMID:16740708, 9103196, 9215690). Mutations of the MEN1 gene cause tumors in pituitary, parathyroid, lung, and enteropancreatic endocrine tissues (PMID: 14992727). Patients with MEN 1 are found to have either mis-sense or truncation mutations within the MEN1 open reading frame, while the second allele is subject to loss of heterozygosity in tumors from these patients (PMID: 9103196). Both MEN1 alleles are inactivated somatically in a variety of sporadic endocrine tumors (PMID: 9361035, 9241276, 9766672). MEN1 was found in a screen for transcriptional repressors of the human telomerase catalytic subunit gene, hTERT (PMID: 12837246). The AP-1 transcription factor JunD and the putative transcription factor Pem, Nf-ÎºB , Smad-3 , replication protein A, nm23, and FANCD2 have been reported to interact with menin (PMID: 9989505, 10500243, 11500056, 11526476, 11274402, 12509449, 11302744, 12874027, 14992727). 44% of Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) had somatic inactivating mutations in MEN1(PMID: 21252315).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4221,"hugoSymbol":"MEN1","name":"menin 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000337652","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000244.3","geneAliases":["MEAI"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"12509449","title":"The 32-kilodalton subunit of replication protein A interacts with menin, the product of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"2003 Jan","volume":"23","issue":"2","pages":"493-509","authors":"Sukhodolets KE et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sukhodolets KE et al.
