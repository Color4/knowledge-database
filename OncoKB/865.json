[{"evidenceId":10842,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CBFB (core-binding factor, beta subunit) gene encodes a heterodimeric transcription factor component, that together with a core-binding factor alpha component, RUNX1/2/3 (Runt related transcription factor) proteins, forms a transcription factor complex (PMID: 8929538). CBFB is a non-DNA binding subunit that functions to enhance the DNA binding of the CBF alpha component. The CBF complex targets specific genes for activation or repression and also recruits activating or repressive cofactors such as p300 and HDACs (Histone deacetylases) (PMID: 23148227, 21059642). CBFB complexed with RUNX1 regulates important steps in hematopoiesis through processes such as cell cycle progression, differentiation and development (PMID: 11561154). With RUNX2, CBFB regulates skeletal development (PMID: 12434152, 24798493). Inversion of chromosome 16 can result in a CBFB-MYH11 (Myosin heavy chain 11) fusion gene and is associated with the M4 type of acute myeloid leukemia, and often with associated eosinophilia (PMID: 23160462). This fusion protein disrupts the CBF complex and results in a block in hematopoiesis (PMID: 20007544). CBFB may also influence solid tumor development, as mutations have been identified in breast and cervical cancer samples (PMID: 22722202, 24390348).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":865,"hugoSymbol":"CBFB","name":"core-binding factor, beta subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000412916","curatedRefSeq":"NM_022845.2","geneAliases":["PEBP2B"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23148227","title":"Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) stimulates tumor suppressor p53 protein in response to DNA damage through complex formation and acetylation.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"2013 Jan 11","volume":"288","issue":"2","pages":"1353-64","authors":"Wu D et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.402594","link":null,"reference":"Wu D et al.
