It is activated in cells that are infected with virus and as a result associates with DDX3X and phophorylates its target protein such as interferon regulatory factors (IRF3, IRF7) (PMID: 23333767, 19160540). As a result of their phosphorylation IRFs translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes such as IFNB. IKBKE also phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B leading to their degredation and further enhancing pro-inflammatory responses (PMID: 23333767, 19160540). It is overexpressed in >30% of primary breast cancer and amplifications affecting IKBKE locus have been observed (PMID: 23333767, 21042276, 17574021). IKBKE has been shown to exhibit oncogenic functions through the phosphorylation of CYLD at serine 418 and TRAF2 at serine 11(PMID: 19481526, 23007157). Additionally IKBKE also phosphorylates NF-kappa-B and AKT1 leading to higher NF-kappa-B activity (PMID: 21908616, 21464307). IKBKE has also been implicated in several other tumor entities (PMID:22942254, 19497997, 20001340, 21271611, 22266464). Recently, IKBKE inhibitors have been developed and are currently tested pre-clinically (PMID: 22305584, 23099093, 19426678).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9641,"hugoSymbol":"IKBKE","name":"inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase epsilon","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000367120","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014002.3","geneAliases":["IKK-i","IKKI","IKK-E","IKKE"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19497997","title":"Deregulation of IKBKE is associated with tumor progression, poor prognosis, and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.","journal":"The American journal of pathology","pubDate":"2009 Jul","volume":"175","issue":"1","pages":"324-33","authors":"Guo JP et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2009.080767","link":null,"reference":"Guo JP et al.
