18661,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"The SPEN gene encodes the protein, SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein (SHARP), mainly involved in transcriptional repression, embryogenesis and development through regulation of the Notch, TCF/LEF, and EGFR signaling pathways. SHARP is a large 402 kDA protein composed of four N-terminal RNA-binding domains and a conserved C-terminal Spen Paralog and Ortholog C-terminal (SPOC) domain. Through these domains, SHARP directly interacts with SMRT, HDAC1, and HDAC2. SPEN also acts as an estrogen-inducible cofactor by binding the steroid receptor RNA coactivator SRA which enhances ERα activity and ultimately modulates the transcription of ERα target genes. (PMID: 11331609, 26297734) Recent studies studying ERα-expressing breast cancer cell lines have identified mutations and LOH in SPEN that lead to underexpression that may be a predictive biomarker of tamoxifen response. ERα-positive breast cell lines expressing higher levels of SPEN correlated with better outcome in patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.
