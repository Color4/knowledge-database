In addition to regulating body axis patterning in embryos, HOXB13 has roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and cell cycle activity (PMID: 28798948). HOXB13 mediates gene expression in a cell-type specific manner due to variation in interactions with adaptor molecules. HOXB13 has been implicated in prostate cell identity, and mice lacking HOXB13 have prostate defects (PMID: 12668621). HOXB13 functions through the androgen receptor (AR) in both normal adult tissue and prostate cancer by regulating the chromatin state around the AR gene, and can have both growth-enhancing or growth-suppressing effects depending on context (PMID: 15604291, 19917249). Germline HOXB13 mutations have been found in familial prostate cancer and are predictive of prostate cancer risk (PMID: 22236224), while somatic HOXB13 mutations have been identified in several other cancer types (PMID: 28798948). Though HOXB13 is overexpressed during malignant progression of prostate and breast cancer (PMID: 20018680), it is downregulated in colorectal and renal cell cancer models, suggesting that it has context-specific effects in human tumors (PMID: 15928669, 16278676, 15193263, 17453342, 23832664).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10481,"hugoSymbol":"HOXB13","name":"homeobox B13","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000290295","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006361.5","geneAliases":["PSGD"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20018680","title":"A FOXA1-binding enhancer regulates Hoxb13 expression in the prostate gland.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2010 Jan 5","volume":"107","issue":"1","pages":"98-103","authors":"McMullin RP et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.0902001107","link":null,"reference":"McMullin RP et al.
