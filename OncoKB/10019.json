It functions mainly as a negative regulator of signal transduction (PMID:11805142, 18753636). SH2B3 is implicated in B-cell development, T-cell activation, and hematopoietic stem cell prolifereation and differentiation (PMID:11114373, 10799879, 11805142). Polymorphisms in SH2B3 are associated with autoimmune disease such as diabetes and celiac disease and hypertension (PMID:19430479, 18311140, 19073967). Germline variants can be associated with autoimmunity and predisposition to leukemia (PMID:23908464). SH2B3 mutations are found in Down syndrome related myeloid disorders, acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (PMID:24056718, 22897847, 20404132, 22237106).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10019,"hugoSymbol":"SH2B3","name":"SH2B adaptor protein 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000341259","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005475.2","geneAliases":["IDDM20","LNK"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11805142","title":"Enhanced hematopoiesis by hematopoietic progenitor cells lacking intracellular adaptor protein, Lnk.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","pubDate":"2002 Jan 21","volume":"195","issue":"2","pages":"151-60","authors":"Takaki S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Takaki S et al.
