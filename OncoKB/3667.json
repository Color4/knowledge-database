Upon activation of INSR IRS1 is phosphorylated and activated leading to the activation of the PI3-Kinase and MAPK pathway (PMID: 1648180, 11292874, 21597332). IRS1 has oncogenic functions in multiple tumor entities such as breast cancer and high IRS1 expression is associated with adverse prognosis (PMID: 17030631, 22337149). IRS-1 associates with BCL-2 and increases its anti-apoptotic functions (PMID: 10679027). IRS-1 interacts with GRB2 leading to JAK activation (PMID: 8491186, 8536716, 9492017). ETV6-NTRK3 induced cell transformation requires high levels of IRS-1 phosphorylation (PMID: 12173038). Phosphorylation of IRS1 S307 seems to abrogate its ability to mediate insulin receptor signalling (PMID: 11606564). Drugs that specifically target the insulin receptor pathway and IRS1 activity have been developed and clinically investigated (PMID: 19581933, 20807783).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3667,"hugoSymbol":"IRS1","name":"insulin receptor substrate 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000305123","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005544.2","geneAliases":["HIRS-1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19581933","title":"Emerging role of insulin-like growth factor receptor inhibitors in oncology: early clinical trial results and future directions.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2009 Aug 27","volume":"28","issue":"34","pages":"3009-21","authors":"Gualberto A et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.172","link":null,"reference":"Gualberto A et al.
