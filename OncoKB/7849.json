The expression of PAX genes is temporally and spatially restricted during organogenesis and these genes play a key role in controlling cell fate during early development (PMID: 24496612). PAX8 is the only member of the family expressed in the thyroid tissue; it is involved in thyroid follicular cell development and expression of thyroid-specific genes, and also functions in very early stages organogenesis of the kidney, the gynecologic tract and the thymus (PMID: 1337742). ). A fusion protein, PAX8-PPARÎ³, is implicated in some follicular thyroid carcinomas and follicular-variant papillary thyroid carcinomas (PMID: 10958784). An array of heterogenous mutations of PAX8 have been seen in thyroid dysgenesis, which causes congenital hypothyroidism (PMID: 25231445).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7849,"hugoSymbol":"PAX8","name":"paired box 8","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263334","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003466.3","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25231445","title":"Clinical genetics of congenital hypothyroidism.","journal":"Endocrine development","pubDate":"2014","volume":"26","issue":"","pages":"60-78","authors":"Szinnai G","elocationId":"doi: 10.1159/000363156","link":null,"reference":"Szinnai G.
