[{"evidenceId":5868,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The AXIN1 gene encodes Axis Inhibition Protein 1, a key component of the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) destruction complex. Negative regulation of beta-catenin by the complex in the absence of an extracellular stimulus is central to WNT signaling (PMID: 20128690, 23169527). In the complex, AXIN1 and AXIN2 provide scaffolding and bind to the tumor suppressor APC (PMID: 14600025) enabling CTNNB1 destruction (PMID: 9734785). AXIN1 is involved in the TGFβ and SAPK pathways (PMID: 15735151). As part of the AXIN-HIPK2-TP53 complex, the protein also plays a role in the control of cell growth, apoptosis and development (PMID: 15526030). Truncating somatic mutations in this gene, typical of a tumor suppressor, have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastomas. Germline mutations in AXIN1 have been associated with gastrointestinal cancers (PMID: 25236910). DNA hypermethylation of the AXIN1 promoter has been associated with caudal duplication anomaly (PMID: 16773576). No drugs targeting the Wnt pathway have yet been approved (PMID: 24981364) although there is some preclinical evidence of disruption of AXIN1 interactions (PMID: 21826110).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-22","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8312,"hugoSymbol":"AXIN1","name":"axin 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262320","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003502.3","geneAliases":["AXIN","PPP1R49"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"15526030","title":"Axin stimulates p53 functions by activation of HIPK2 kinase through multimeric complex formation.","journal":"The EMBO journal","pubDate":"2004 Nov 24","volume":"23","issue":"23","pages":"4583-94","authors":"Rui Y et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Rui Y et al.
