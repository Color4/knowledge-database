It belongs to the PRDM family of genes, which exert both positive and negative roles in the transcription of genes involved in development, and either possess or enhance histone methyltransferase activity (PMID: 22669819, 22028065). PRDM14 plays an important role in the establishment of germ cell lineage in mice (PMID: 18665129, 18622394). Additionally, PRDM14 is required for the maintenance of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) identity, and enhances the reprogramming of human fibroblasts into hESC by co-regulating the expression of key genes (PMID: 20953172, 24268575). PRDM14 overexpression in breast cancer cells leads to increased growth and colony formation capabilities and decreased apoptosis (PMID: 17942894). PRDM14 is overexpressed or amplified in a subset of breast and prostate cancers (PMID: 17942894; cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":63978,"hugoSymbol":"PRDM14","name":"PR domain 14","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000276594","curatedRefSeq":"NM_024504.3","geneAliases":["PFM11"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18622394","title":"Critical function of Prdm14 for the establishment of the germ cell lineage in mice.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2008 Aug","volume":"40","issue":"8","pages":"1016-22","authors":"Yamaji M et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.186","link":null,"reference":"Yamaji M et al.
