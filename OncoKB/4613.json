MYCN has been shown to function both as a transcriptional activator and repressor, regulating the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism and regulation of the tumor microenvironment among other processes (PMID: 16934487, 20399964). The MYCN gene is organized into an N-terminus transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminus basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper DNA-binding domain. Unlike c-MYC, which is ubiquitously expressed, expression of n-MYC is temporally restricted to embryonic development and spatially restricted to cells of the nervous system, kidney, lung and spleen. Amplification of MYCN is predominantly associated with cancers of neural origin (e.g. neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma), but has been observed in other solid tumors including prostate, breast and small cell lung cancers (PMID: 24589438, 16934487,15013217). Targeting MYCN directly has been challenging, and therefore therapeutic strategies have focused on targeting MYCN downstream targets or factors involved in MYCN transcriptional activity or regulating MYCN stability (PMID: 24857145, 24086065).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4613,"hugoSymbol":"MYCN","name":"v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000281043","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005378.4","geneAliases":["ODED","MODED","bHLHe37","N-myc","NMYC"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24589438","title":"The N-myc Oncogene: Maximizing its Targets, Regulation, and Therapeutic Potential.","journal":"Molecular cancer research : MCR","pubDate":"2014 Jun","volume":"12","issue":"6","pages":"815-22","authors":"Beltran H","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0536","link":null,"reference":"Beltran H.
