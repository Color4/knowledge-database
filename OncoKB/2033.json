EP300 activates transcription by opening chromatin at gene promoters, recruiting transcriptional machinery and acting as a co-factor to recruit transcription factors (PMID: 15186775, 24480624, 11050151, 23474763, 15691758). The HAT activity of EP300 can also regulate the expression of other proteins, including the tumor suppressor p53 and tissue-specific transcription factors like GATA1 (PMID: 9830059, 9859997). Fusion proteins that include the EP300 HAT domain have been identified in rare cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (PMID: 25943178). Somatic mutations in EP300 are found in leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors including small-cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and bladder cancer (PMID: 21390126, 22941188, 24390348, 21822268). EP300 mutations are commonly truncating and often co-occur with loss of the wildtype allele, suggesting that EP300 functions as a tumor suppressor. Small molecule inhibitors targeting EP300 have been found to be efficacious in preclinical and mouse studies (PMID: 26731516).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2033,"hugoSymbol":"EP300","name":"E1A binding protein p300","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263253","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001429.3","geneAliases":["p300","KAT3B","RSTS2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"15186775","title":"Ordered cooperative functions of PRMT1, p300, and CARM1 in transcriptional activation by p53.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"2004 Jun 11","volume":"117","issue":"6","pages":"735-48","authors":"An W et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"An W et al.
