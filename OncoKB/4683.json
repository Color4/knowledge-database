The complex activates the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related) to initiate DNA damage response and is itself phosphorylated by ATM (PMID:23525106, 23582259, 26512707, 10802669). The complex has DNA nuclease activity important for stimulating repair (PMID:18854157). Activation of the MRN complex enables the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint response to DNA damage (PMID:14657032). The complex is also important for genomic integrity at telomeres, replication forks, immunoglobulin gene loci during rearrangements, and DNA breaks formed in meiosis (PMID:19667071, 21565612, 16285919, 17291760). Activation of repair mechanisms include non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair (PMID:12422221, 24316220). NBN mutation is associated with the Nijmegen breakage syndrome, characterized by increased cancer incidence, microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and ionizing radiation sensitivity (PMID: 9590180, 9590181). Mutations have been found in cholangiocarcinoma, liver, prostate cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, medulloblastoma, and other cancers (PMID:24349281, 22864661, 21923652,18593981,18056440). Mutations and copy number alterations in NBN may lead to susceptibility to radiation and specific inhibitors related to DNA damage including Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors (PMID:22396666, 25324139, 25415046, 24240112).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4683,"hugoSymbol":"NBN","name":"nibrin","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000265433","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002485.4","geneAliases":["ATV","NBS1","AT-V2","P95","NBS","AT-V1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18854157","title":"Mre11 nuclease activity has essential roles in DNA repair and genomic stability distinct from ATM activation.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"2008 Oct 3","volume":"135","issue":"1","pages":"85-96","authors":"Buis J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2008.08.015","link":null,"reference":"Buis J et al.
