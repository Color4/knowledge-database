[{"evidenceId":7218,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RAD51C (RAD51 paralog C) encodes a member of the family of RAD51 proteins, which function in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). RAD51C is one of five RAD51 paralogs (PMID: 17114795). Although its function is poorly understood, RAD51C is likely involved in resolving Holliday junctions (HJs) at a late stage of homologous recombination (PMID: 17547768). RAD51C is a member of both HR-related complexes, BCDX2 (RAD51B/C/D and XRCC2) and CX3 (RAD51C and XRCC3), which act at different stages in the HR pathway (PMID: 16093548, 23149936). Preclinical studies have shown that deficiency in either complex reduces cellular ability to resolve HJs (PMID: 17114795, 14716019). Biallelic germline mutations of RAD51C are associated with a Fanconi anemia-like disorder (PMID: 20400963). Germline RAD51C mutations confer susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer (PMID: 20400964, 21616938, 21990120, 22538716), as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 24315737). Somatic alterations in RAD51C are infrequently found in cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov. 2015). The gene is located at a locus amplified in some tumor but although evidence for elevated expression exists no mechanism implying a role for RAD51C in the progression in these tumors (PMID: 11034067, 11034073).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5889,"hugoSymbol":"RAD51C","name":"RAD51 paralog C","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000337432","curatedRefSeq":"NM_058216.2","geneAliases":["BROVCA3","R51H3","FANCO","RAD51L2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"23149936","title":"Rad51 paralog complexes BCDX2 and CX3 act at different stages in the BRCA1-BRCA2-dependent homologous recombination pathway.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"2013 Jan","volume":"33","issue":"2","pages":"387-95","authors":"Chun J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1128/MCB.00465-12","link":null,"reference":"Chun J et al.
