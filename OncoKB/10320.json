IKZF1 functions in hematopoietic stem cells to induce lymphoid specification and differentiation (PMID: 19345118, 16518393). As a transcription factor, IKZF1 alters chromatin and regulates gene expression by recruiting histone deactylases and chromatin remodeling ATPases to target genes (PMID: 10204490). IKZF1 is the target of lenalidomide induced degradation in multiple myeloma and its degradation is a key component of the drug's activity in myeloma (PMID: 24292625). IKZF1 mutations and deletions are most commonly found in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) and may be a mechanism of leukemic transformation in Philadelphia chromosome positive (BCR-ABL) B-ALLs (PMID: 17344859, 18408710). Mutation of IKZF1 is associated with poor prognosis in B-ALL (PMID: 19129520). It is also deleted more rarely in other leukemias such as acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 26069293, 25331116, 24072100)","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10320,"hugoSymbol":"IKZF1","name":"IKAROS family zinc finger 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000331340","curatedRefSeq":"ENST00000331340","geneAliases":["CVID13","IKAROS","PRO0758","LyF-1","LYF1","Hs.54452","ZNFN1A1","IK1","PPP1R92"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26069293","title":"Recurrent deletions of IKZF1 in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia.","journal":"Haematologica","pubDate":"2015 Sep","volume":"100","issue":"9","pages":"1151-9","authors":"de Rooij JD et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.124321","link":null,"reference":"de Rooij JD et al.
