[{"evidenceId":4819,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The BTK (Bruton’s agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase) gene encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase particularly important in B-lymphocyte biology. Loss of function mutations in BTK lead to B-cell deficiencies and immunodeficiency known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) (PMID: 8380905). Patients with XLA fail to produce sufficient immunoglobulin and have a deficient humoral immune response. BTK is activated by the B-cell Receptor (BCR) when BCR associated tyrosine kinases (such as SYK and LYN) phosphorylates BTK at the plasma membrane at residue Y551 (PMID: 8629002). The major target of BTK phosphorylation is phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2). Activation of PLCγ2 by BTK results in Ca++ influx and activation of the NFAT, NFkB and MAPK pathways (PMID: 8691147, 10811867). BTK signaling is also implicated in chemokine receptor signaling in lymphocyte trafficking and in Toll-like receptor signaling in the immune response (PMID: 17239630, 23967355). BTK signaling is critical for growth of B-cell derived malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple myeloma (MM) and waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) (PMID: 24658273). BTK can be over-expressed in B-cell malignancies (PMID: 21422473, 23962569). In AML cells, BTK was shown to be involved in signaling from FLT3-ITD and TLR9 receptors that were important for cell survival and proliferation (PMID: 25605370). BTK inhibition has been a successful means of therapy in hematologic malignancies. However, acquired resistance has been observed through mutations in BTK itself and in downstream effectors such as PLCG2 (PMID: 24869598), while primary refractory disease has been observed in alternative signaling pathways that activate the same target pathways, such as specific mutations in CXCR4 (PMID: 24912431) and MYD88 (Abstract: Wilson et al.
