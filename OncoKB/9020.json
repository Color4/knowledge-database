Following ligand stimulation, the TRAFT2/3 ubiquitin ligase complex releases MAP3K14, which then phosphorylates and activates IKK-α homodimers; in turn, these phosphorylate and activate a precursor protein of the NF-kB complex, p100, triggering its cleavage and ultimately activation of the NF-kB cascade (PMID: 11520989, 11239468, 22435551). Through its role in NF-kB signaling, MAP3K14 influences a wide range of cellular processes, including regulation of B and T cells (PMID: 14764671, 16034105, 18799149, 10878354, 10637282), production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (PMID: 18997792, 18997794), formation of osteoclasts (PMID: 12939342) and response to viral infection (PMID: 9182687, 20685151, 18550535). Mice lacking MAP3K14 or expressing a mutant form of the protein that is unable to interact with IKK-α are immunodeficient, with a reduced B cell population and a lack of lymph nodes; such mice exhibit disrupted splenic and lymphoid organ architecture (PMID: 11069060, 10878354, 8605936, 25406581). In addition, MAP3K14 plays a major role in liver metabolism. Overexpression of MAP3K14 has been linked to lethal liver inflammation and fibrosis; in obese mice, high levels of MAP3K14 result in hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance (PMID: 22581287, 25088600). MAP3K14 overexpression caused by amplification or translocation has been observed in various hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma (PMID: 17692804, 17692805, 21881048, 22469134). Although less common, aberrant expression of NIK has been observed in some solid tumor models, including pancreatic cancer, lung cancer and melanoma (PMID: 19646419, 20338663, 1177306).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-25","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9020,"hugoSymbol":"MAP3K14","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000344686","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003954.3","geneAliases":["NIK","HSNIK","HS","FTDCR1B"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22469134","title":"Genetic lesions of the TRAF3 and MAP3K14 genes in classical Hodgkin lymphoma.","journal":"British journal of haematology","pubDate":"2012 Jun","volume":"157","issue":"6","pages":"702-8","authors":"Otto C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09113.x","link":null,"reference":"Otto C et al.
