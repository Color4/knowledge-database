[{"evidenceId":12712,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CDK6 encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase 6 which is one of the serine/threonine kinases that controls the checkpoint at G1-S phase. Upon receiving mitogenic signals, it forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D, phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (RB), thus leading to the induction of a gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors (PMID: 12432268). The negative regulator of CDK4/6, p16INK4a (encoded by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene, CDKN2A), binds to the catalytic domains of the kinases and interferes with cyclin D and ATP binding (PMID: 9751050, 11124804). As CDK4 and CDK6 have partially overlapping and redundant physiological roles and they both regulates the cell cycle, alterations in CDK6 expression and activity may likely to promote tumorigenesis in a way similar to CDK4 (PMID: 15315761). For instances, CDK6 is shown to induce the expression of VEGF-A in lymphoid leukemia, thus it not only promotes cell proliferation but angiogeneisis as well (PMID: 23948297). CDK6 amplification has been observed in several cancer types, such as esophageal carcinoma, leukemia and lymphoma (PMID: 21593195, 22450065, 24423610, 9422538, 10879740, 16782810). However mutations in CDK6 are rarely detected in cancers (cBioportal, MSKCC, May. 2015) and there are very little functional data on their roles in tumorigenesis or therapeutics responses.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1021,"hugoSymbol":"CDK6","name":"cyclin dependent kinase 6","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000265734","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001145306.1","geneAliases":["PLSTIRE","MCPH12"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16782810","title":"Gene expression patterns define novel roles for E47 in cell cycle progression, cytokine-mediated signaling, and T lineage development.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2006 Jun 27","volume":"103","issue":"26","pages":"9976-81","authors":"Schwartz R et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Schwartz R et al.
