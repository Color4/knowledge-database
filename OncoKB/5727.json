PTCH1 functions as the primary receptor for sonic hedgehog (SHH), a secreted protein involved in embryonic development (PMID: 11001584, 8906787). In response to SHH, PTCH1 binds and inhibits Smoothened (SMO), a G protein-coupled receptor; this results in decreased signaling via the HH pathway (PMID: 14737121). Thus, PTCH1 functions as a classic tumor suppressor by inhibiting SMO-mediated oncogenic signaling. Germline PTCH1 mutations are associated with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS, Gorlin syndrome), which predisposes patients to basal cell carcinoma as well as medulloblastoma (PMID: 8658145). Recurrent somatic inactivating PTCH1 mutations have been identified in basal cell carcinoma (PMID: 26950094) and medulloblastoma, suggesting that mutant PTCH1 is a primary driver of these diseases (PMID: 21107850, 22832583, 24651015, 22820256, 21163964, 22832581). As inactivating PTCH1 mutations lead to increased SMO activity recently developed SMO inhibitors show promising responses in PTCH1 mutant tumors (PMID: 24651015, 26169613).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-22","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5727,"hugoSymbol":"PTCH1","name":"patched 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000331920","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000264.3","geneAliases":["NBCCS","PTC1","BCNS","HPE7","PTCH11","PTCH","PTC"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"26950094","title":"Genomic analysis identifies new drivers and progression pathways in skin basal cell carcinoma.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2016 Apr","volume":"48","issue":"4","pages":"398-406","authors":"Bonilla X et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.3525","link":null,"reference":"Bonilla X et al.
