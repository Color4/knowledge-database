HGF is primarily expressed as pro-HGF and needs proteolytic activation to form HGF (PMID: 22270953, 1826653). MET activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of various effector proteins such as PLC, GAB1, GRB2 and SRC. HGF/MET signaling is physiolgically required for liver and skin regeneration as well as Epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) in embryogenesis. In cancer, HGF/MET signaling is involved in stemness, metastasis and angiogenesis (PMID: 22270953). Downstream effectors in the context of cancer involve the WNT-beta-catenin pathway, PI3K-AKT as well as TGFbeta signalling. A number of small molecule and antibody based MET receptor inhibitors have been developed and are tested in clinical trials with variable results.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3082,"hugoSymbol":"HGF","name":"hepatocyte growth factor","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000222390","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000601.4","geneAliases":["F-TCF","DFNB39","HPTA","HGFB"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22270953","title":"Targeting MET in cancer: rationale and progress.","journal":"Nature reviews.
