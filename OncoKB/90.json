[{"evidenceId":6494,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ACVR1 protein (activin receptor type 1 protein) is a transmembrane protein with cytosolic serine/threonine activity that participates in signaling of transforming growth factor β superfamily members, including BMPs and activins, via the formation of a heteromeric complex. This signaling complex is composed of 2 type 1 receptors which are essential for intracellular signaling and 2 type 2 receptors which are essential for ligand binding. Binding of the ligand to the type 2 receptor stabilizes the complex and results in phosphorylation of type 1 receptors, thus resulting in downstream signaling mediated by the SMAD family of proteins (PMID: 15621726). In normal tissues, signaling through the activin receptor type 1 regulates cell survival, differentiation and proliferation. Somatic gain of function mutations in ACVR1 are the basis of the autosomal dominant condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP), which results in heterotopic ossification in humans (PMID: 25337067) and similar mutations are present in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (PMID: 24769718).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":90,"hugoSymbol":"ACVR1","name":"activin A receptor type 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263640","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001111067.2","geneAliases":["SKR1","TSRI","FOP","ACVRLK2","ACTRI","ALK2","ACVR1A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25337067","title":"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva: clinical course, genetic mutations and genotype-phenotype correlation.","journal":"Molecular syndromology","pubDate":"2014 Aug","volume":"5","issue":"5","pages":"201-11","authors":"Hüning I et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1159/000365770","link":null,"reference":"Hüning I et al.
