[{"evidenceId":7518,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CHEK1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1) encodes a serine/threonine kinase that plays an integral role in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. In response to DNA damage, CHEK1 is activated by the kinases ATR and ATM (PMID: 12781359) via phosphorylation. Once activated, CHEK1 acts as an effector kinase, mediating downstream signaling that leads to a diverse range of cellular responses, including cell cycle checkpoint activation, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and/or apoptosis (PMID: 23508805). These responses prevent damaged cells from continuing through the cell cycle or proliferating. CHEK1 is often described as \"the guardian of the genome\" because it monitors DNA integrity during unperturbed cell cycles as well as replication of cells that have sustained DNA damage from exogenous sources. Although its roles in DNA damage and repair are consistent with tumor suppressor behavior, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in CHEK1 have not been identified in tumors (PMID: 15459660), and CHEK1 mutations are extremely rare (PMID: 12781359). However, CHEK1 is frequently over-expressed in a variety of tumors, including liver (PMID: 22585575), breast (PMID: 17638866), colon (PMID: 17848589), non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 24418519 ) and nasopharyngeal cancers (PMID: 15297395).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1111,"hugoSymbol":"CHEK1","name":"checkpoint kinase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000428830","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001274.5","geneAliases":["CHK1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17848589","title":"A proteomics analysis of cell signaling alterations in colorectal cancer.","journal":"Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP","pubDate":"2007 Dec","volume":"6","issue":"12","pages":"2150-64","authors":"Madoz-Gúrpide J et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Madoz-Gúrpide J et al.
