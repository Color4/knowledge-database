[{"evidenceId":15667,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MLH1 protein is essential for DNA mismatch repair pathway. This pathway is an intracellular mechanism used to correct mismatched nucleotides and insertion/deletion loops that are erroneously incorporated into the newly synthesized strand of DNA during replication, using the parental strand of DNA as a template. As part of this pathway, MLH1 heterodimerizes with PMS2 (most commonly), PMS1 or MLH3 to form an endonuclease complex that incises the damaged strand, leading to its local excision (PMID: 10037723, 10542278, 10615123). Mutations in MLH1 lead to an inability to correctly repair mismatches and insertion/deletion loops, which are most frequently associated with microsatellite repeat sequences. Alterations in microsatellite repeat sequences can be particularly deleterious with their potential to create frameshift mutations in a variety of other genes. Mutations in MLH1 occur in multiple tissue types, but are most common in a specific subset of sporadic colon, gastric and endometrial cancers, as well as the inherited lynch syndrome, sometimes referred to as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) (PMID: 8484122, 8040889, 8261393). MLH1 acts as a classic tumor suppressor gene, where loss of function of one allele due to an inherited or somatic mutation is eventually accompanied by the loss of function of the other allele through one of several mechanisms, such as mutation, loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing. Clinically, mutational status of specific DNA mismatch repair genes is not frequently tested. However, a screening test for micro satellite instability (MSI) is commonly used to identify a non-specific defect of the mismatch repair system (PMID: 9823339, 12454837). Tumors with inactivating MLH1 mutations are likely to exhibit an MSI-high phenotype. Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage or inhibition of other DNA-repair/synthesis pathway genes has been shown in model systems to mediate synthetic lethality. Examples of this include increased sensitivity to a PARP-1 inhibitor in colorectal cancer cell lines with mutated MRE11, cytotoxicity of methotrexate and POLB/POLG inhibitors in MSH2- and MLH1-deficient cells, respectively (PMID: 21300766, 20227038, 20823149, 21285347, 20049736). Indeed, defects in the MMR pathway have been associated with improved response to radio- and chemotherapy and immunotherapy (PMID: 20153885, 26028255). In specific regard to immunotherapy, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for all mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) and MSI tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4292,"hugoSymbol":"MLH1","name":"mutL homolog 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000231790","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000249.3","geneAliases":["HNPCC","HNPCC2","FCC2","COCA2","hMLH1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"8261393","title":"Microsatellite instability is associated with tumors that characterize the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma syndrome.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"1993 Dec 15","volume":"53","issue":"24","pages":"5853-5","authors":"Peltom채ki P et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Peltom채ki P et al.
