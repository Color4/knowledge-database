RAC2 regulates variouscellular processes such as secretion, cytoskeletal re-organization, cellpolarization (specifically lamellopodial extension and membrane ruffling), and phagocytosis(PMID: 16949823). RAC2 has been identified as a component of the phagocyticoxidase complex in neutrophils, and a dominant negative mutation (D57N) in RAC2is associated with phagocyte immunodeficiency in humans (PMID: 10961859, 15814684,21167572). In addition, RAC2 is involved in multiple kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling networks (PMID: 7664330, 9042860, 10843388). Unlike RAC1 and RAC3, RAC2 is expressed specifically in cells ofhematopoietic lineages (PMID: 23850828, 12370311), and RAC2-deficient micedemonstrate cellular defects in multiple hematopoietic lineages, including stemand progenitor cells, neutrophils, mast cells, T and B cells (PMID:12370311, 11057896, 11320224). Mouse models have revealed a distinct role for RAC2 in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis (PMID: 24770346) and loss of RAC2 causes a significant delay in thedevelopment of BCR-ABL-driven myeloproliferative disorders (PMID: 17996650).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-24","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5880,"hugoSymbol":"RAC2","name":"ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (rho family, small GTP binding protein Rac2)","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000249071","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002872.4","geneAliases":["Gx","EN-7","p21-Rac2","HSPC022"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16949823","title":"Rho GTPases and actin dynamics in membrane protrusions and vesicle trafficking.","journal":"Trends in cell biology","pubDate":"2006 Oct","volume":"16","issue":"10","pages":"522-9","authors":"Ridley AJ","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Ridley AJ.
