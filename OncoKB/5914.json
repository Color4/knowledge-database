RARA heterodimerizes with the RXR nuclear receptor and is activated by binding retinoid ligands (PMID: 1310350). Binding of the ligand results in a conformational change and recruits histone acetyltransferases and chromatin remodeling ATPases that activate transcription (PMID: 8274399, 11106744). RARA signaling is involved in development of multiple tissue types, hematopoiesis, and stem cell specification (PMID: 9053308, 10529422, 24074870). Translocations between RARA and PML is implicated in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (PMID: 23841729). The fusion protein confers sensitivity to targeted treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide (PMID: 20378816). Other rarer translocations partners with RARA have also been observed in APL (PMID: 25583766, 25629986, 23287866, 26414475, 20807888, 9288109). The RARA gene can also be methylated and reduced in expression other leukemias (PMID: 17993618). RARA mutations have been observed in breast fibroepithelial tumors (PMID: 26437033). The gene is also amplified in a subset of breast cancers and can interact with the estrogen receptor (PMID: 23830798, 20080953).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5914,"hugoSymbol":"RARA","name":"retinoic acid receptor alpha","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000254066","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000964.3","geneAliases":["RAR","NR1B1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20378816","title":"Arsenic trioxide controls the fate of the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein by directly binding PML.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2010 Apr 9","volume":"328","issue":"5975","pages":"240-3","authors":"Zhang XW et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1126/science.1183424","link":null,"reference":"Zhang XW et al.
