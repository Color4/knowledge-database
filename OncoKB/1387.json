[{"evidenceId":2129,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CREBBP (CREB binding protein) is a transcriptional co-activator with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity; it is closely homologous to the co-activator EP300 (PMID: 8004670, 18273021). As a co-factor, CREBBP binds to DNA binding proteins where it functions as a scaffold to recruit a range of transcription complex components (PMID: 9215639, 9445474). CREBBP itself can recruit the basal transcriptional machinery, and through its HAT activity acetylate lysine tails to modify chromatin into a more open conformation for active transcription (PMID: 8576192,8967953). The HAT activity of CREBBP is also active on non-histone proteins, including tumor suppressors such as p53 and tissue-specific transcription factors such as GATA1 (PMID: 9830059, 9859997). In leukemias, CREBBP can be disrupted by translocations that fuse the HAT domain with the MOZ/KAT6A (lysine acetyltransferase 6a) protein t(8;16) (PMID: 9447825). Somatic mutations of CREBBP have been found in leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors including small-cell lung cancer, squamous carcinoma and bladder cancer (PMID: 24670651, 21796119, 21390130, 25151357, 21390130). Most CREBBP mutations are truncating and commonly co-occur with loss of the wildtype allele, suggesting that CREBBP is a tumor suppressor. Inherited mutations can result in the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome with stereotypical facial and digit abnormalities along with neurological deficits (PMID:7630403). CREBBP-mutated tumors are dependent on EP300 activity and inhibitors targeting EP300 are efficacious in CREBBP-mutated cell line and mouse models (PMID: 26603525).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1387,"hugoSymbol":"CREBBP","name":"CREB binding protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262367","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004380.2","geneAliases":["CBP","KAT3A","RSTS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"9859997","title":"Regulation of activity of the transcription factor GATA-1 by acetylation.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"1998 Dec 10","volume":"396","issue":"6711","pages":"594-8","authors":"Boyes J et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Boyes J et al.
