It was originally identified as a contributing enzyme in the pathogenesis of Huntington Disease and thus was initially named Huntington Interacting Protein B (HYPB) (PMID: 9700202). Histone methylation is a highly controlled biological process that regulates gene expression by altering the ability of RNA polymerase II to interact with DNA and thus initiate transcription (PMID:16118227, 25123655). Additionally, the SETD2-regulated H3K36 histone mark has been shown to play a role in regulating DNA mismatch repair. This suggests that inactivation of this protein can lead to enhanced genetic instability, enrichment of nonsense and frameshift mutations and ultimately oncogenic transformation of cells (PMID: 23622243, 25123655, 25728682, 24931610). Importantly, SETD2-mutant renal tumors failed to activate the p53 tumor suppressor, thus providing an alternative pathway for the inactivation of p53 that leads to defects in DNA damage repair (PMID: 24843002).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":29072,"hugoSymbol":"SETD2","name":"SET domain containing 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000409792","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014159.6","geneAliases":["HIF-1","HYPB","LLS","p231HBP","KMT3A","SET2","HIP-1","HSPC069","HBP231"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24843002","title":"SETD2 is required for DNA double-strand break repair and activation of the p53-mediated checkpoint.","journal":"eLife","pubDate":"2014 May 6","volume":"3","issue":"","pages":"e02482","authors":"Carvalho S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.7554/eLife.02482","link":null,"reference":"Carvalho S et al. eLife. 2014 May 6;3()e02482.","abstract":null},{"pmid":"25728682","title":"SETD2 loss-of-function promotes renal cancer branched evolution through replication stress and impaired DNA repair.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2015 Nov 12","volume":"34","issue":"46","pages":"5699-708","authors":"Kanu N et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.24","link":null,"reference":"Kanu N et al.
