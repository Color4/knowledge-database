BCL6 regulates a general transcriptional program of genes involved in lymphocyte activation, differentiation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis and suppresses terminal differentiation of germinal center B-cells (PMID: 10981963, 11452114). Downregulation of BCL6 is necessary for further B-cell differentiation (PMID: 18452090). BCL6 is a proto-oncogene located on chromosome arm 3q27, which is commonly translocated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (PMID: 15202519, 8167331). This translocation, as well as BCL6 somatic mutations found in DLBCL, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and breast cancer, are proposed to deregulate BCL6 expression, resulting in its oncogenic potential (PMID: 25038272, 18452090, 24662818). In vitro studies have shown that inhibition of BCL6 results in reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, and thus BCL6 has been proposed as a therapeutic target (PMID: 24662818).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":604,"hugoSymbol":"BCL6","name":"B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000232014","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001706.4","geneAliases":["ZBTB27","ZNF51","BCL6A","LAZ3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15202519","title":"Molecular pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: the role of Bcl-6.","journal":"Leukemia &amp; lymphoma","pubDate":"2003","volume":"44 Suppl 3","issue":"","pages":"S5-12","authors":"Pasqualucci L et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Pasqualucci L et al.
