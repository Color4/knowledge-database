The CASP8 protein is the main initiator caspase that mediates death receptor-induced apoptosis. CD95 (Fas/Apo1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors and TNF receptors are involved in activating the signaling cascade through formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which ultimately leads to proteolytic activation of CASP8 (PMID: 25617598, 18073771). Upon activation, CASP8 can directly cleave other caspases, such as caspase-3, or engage the mitochondrial pathway by cleavage of BID (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) (PMID: 9727492, 9501089, 10428830). Additionally, CASP8 is involved in mediating the anti-apoptotic NF-ÎºB pathway (PMID: 11002417, 10753878, 15746428) and inhibiting receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3)-dependent necroptosis (PMID: 21368763, 24476434). Other non-proteolytic functions of CASP8 have been identified in neuroblastoma and lung cancer cell lines including promotion of cell adhesion (PMID: 18089800, 18089778), motility (PMID: 18216014, 16618751, 18089778) and metastasis (PMID: 16397500). Various inactivating somatic mutations as well as gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation of CASP8 have been observed in different cancers including hepatocellular, gastric, colorectal, central nervous system malignancies and head and neck cancers. Caspase-8 deficiency state (CEDS) is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by CASP8 mutations and resembles autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) (PMID: 12353035).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":841,"hugoSymbol":"CASP8","name":"caspase 8","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000358485","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001080125.1","geneAliases":["ALPS2B","Casp-8","MCH5","MACH","FLICE","CAP4"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"16397500","title":"Potentiation of neuroblastoma metastasis by loss of caspase-8.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2006 Jan 5","volume":"439","issue":"7072","pages":"95-9","authors":"Stupack DG et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Stupack DG et al.
