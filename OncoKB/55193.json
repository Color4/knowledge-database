Nucleosomes are histone octamers around which DNA is wrapped in order to regulate its exposure to transcription factors and RNA polymerases (PMID: 23113498). Remodeling complexes such as the SWI/SNF family serve to loosen, reposition and break DNA/histone contacts ultimately rendering the DNA accessible to modulation (PMID: 21654818). BAF180 contains 6 bromodomains, which bind to lysine residues in histone tails (PMID:19084573, PMID:22435813). Aberrations of each individual bromodomain are sufficient to disrupt the protein's function as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 22435813, PMID:24613357). Specifically, one study demonstrated that BAF180 is among the key components required for p53-dependent cellular senescence (PMID:20660729). Additional work focusing on breast cancer cell lines identified BAF180 as a critical promoter in the induction of p21 activity, which functions as a key component of cell cycle regulatory functions (PMID:18339845). PBRM1 truncation mutants can no longer bind and remodel the p21 locus leading to cell cycle defects and aberrant cell proliferation (PMID: 18339845, 22949125). Loss of PBRM1 activity is also associated with chromosomal instability due to its inability to promote cohesion (PMID: 24613357).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":55193,"hugoSymbol":"PBRM1","name":"polybromo 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000394830","curatedRefSeq":"NM_018313.4","geneAliases":["BAF180","PB1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"19084573","title":"Polybromo-1: the chromatin targeting subunit of the PBAF complex.","journal":"Biochimie","pubDate":"2009 Mar","volume":"91","issue":"3","pages":"309-19","authors":"Thompson M","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2008.10.019","link":null,"reference":"Thompson M.
