The ARID domain defines a highly conserved family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (PMID: 8543152, 8622680) that appears to play a role in diverse biological functions including embryonic development, lymphocyte development, cell-type specific gene expression and cell growth regulation (PMID:15640446). ARID5B has been shown to be a binding partner of the demethylase, PHF2 (PMID: 21532585); the ARID5B-PHF2 complex binds to the promoters of SOX9 target genes to transcriptionally activate chondrogenesis (PMID: 24276541). Importantly, ARID5B polymorphisms confer increased risk of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as determined by two independent genome-wide association studies (PMID: 19684604, 19684603). Both studies determined that ARID5B predisposition loci were enriched in patients with a specific subtype of ALL, named B-cell hyperdiploid ALL. It was further determined that these patients show significant association with the clinical phenotype of intracellular accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamates, which is consistent with greater sensitivity to methotrexate-based chemotherapies (PMID: 19684603, 19710713). However, it is unknown how these alleles confer greater risk of childhood ALL development.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-22","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":84159,"hugoSymbol":"ARID5B","name":"AT-rich interaction domain 5B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000279873","curatedRefSeq":"NM_032199.2","geneAliases":["MRF-2","MRF2","DESRT"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"19710713","title":"Inherited susceptibility to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2009 Sep","volume":"41","issue":"9","pages":"957-8","authors":"Levine RL","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng0909-957","link":null,"reference":"Levine RL.
