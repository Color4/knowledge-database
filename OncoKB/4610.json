The architecture of the MYCL gene shows substantial homology with the other members of the human MYC gene family (MYC and MYCN) (PMID:10378696). Unlike MYC, which is expressed ubiquitously, MYCL is preferentially expressed in the developing kidney and lung (PMID: 8657155), and appears to be less potent in terms of transformation potential (PMID: 2457153). Reports of cancer-associated genomic alterations of MYCL are predominantly limited to small cell lung carcinomas, where MYCL is found amplified in approximately 5-10% of samples (PMID: 2997622,1327035). Amplification of other MYC family members also occurs in small cell lung cancer, and in some cases these amplifications may co-occur with amplifications of MYCL (PMID:10378696,1327035).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4610,"hugoSymbol":"MYCL","name":"v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene lung carcinoma derived homolog","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000397332","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001033082.2","geneAliases":["L-Myc","LMYC","bHLHe38","MYCL1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8657155","title":"Expression and activity of L-Myc in normal mouse development.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"1996 Apr","volume":"16","issue":"4","pages":"1794-804","authors":"Hatton KS et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Hatton KS et al.
