[{"evidenceId":18354,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"SMARCB1 (INI1, BAF47, SNF5) is present in all known variants of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and is thus considered a core subunit (PMID: 10078207). SWI/SNF complexes are ATP dependent nucleosome remodelers which are required for efficient accessibility of genes to the transcriptional machinery (PMID: 14964309). SWI/SNF complexes are important for normal human development and are required for the transition of transcriptional programs during cellular differentiation(PMID: 23568486). In cancer, SMARCB1 acts as a strong tumor suppressor. It is mutated in rhabdoid tumours, familial schwannomatosis, small-cell hepatoblastomas, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, undifferentiated sarcomas, epitheliod sarcomas, meningiomas and poorly differentiated chordomas (PMID: 9671307, 21057957, 17357086, 18985717, 18580682, 18997735, 15899790, 20930055). Heterozygous SMARCB1 mutations are found in patients with rhabdoid predisposition syndrome, which is characterized by the inheritance of a defective SMARCB1 allele followed by the loss of the remaining allele in the tumours (PMID: 10521299). Mouse models of SMARCB1 mutations recapitulate the tumor suppressor functions observed in humans (PMID: 11095756, 12450796, 16301525). The exact mechanism by which SMARCB1 loss leads to malignant transformation is not yet well understood, however, expression analyses have shown that one consequence of SMARCB1 loss is the activation of gene expression programmes that are associated with proliferation and dedifferentiation (PMID: 21076395). Recently, it was found that SMARCB1 mutant cells depend on the PRC2 component EZH2 which has lead to clinical trials of EZH2 inhibitors in patients with SMARCB1 mutant cancers (PMID: 21654818, 20951942, 26552009, 23620515).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-05","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6598,"hugoSymbol":"SMARCB1","name":"SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily b, member 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263121","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003073.3","geneAliases":["MRD15","hSNFS","SNF5L1","Sfh1p","RTPS1","SWNTS1","BAF47","PPP1R144","SNF5","Snr1","CSS3","INI1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"10078207","title":"Reconstitution of a core chromatin remodeling complex from SWI/SNF subunits.","journal":"Molecular cell","pubDate":"1999 Feb","volume":"3","issue":"2","pages":"247-53","authors":"Phelan ML et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Phelan ML et al.
