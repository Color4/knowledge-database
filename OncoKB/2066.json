[{"evidenceId":16965,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ERBB4 gene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase in the ERBB family of receptors that plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system, lung, heart and mammary glands (PMID: 14504474, 9208852, 22427524, 25492965). Binding of its ligands, the neuregulins (NRG1-4), betacellulin (BTC), HB-EGF or epiregulin (EPR), is required for ERBB4 to form kinase active dimers with other ERBB isoforms, preferentially ERBB2. In turn, this initiates downstream signaling via the oncogenic PI3-kinase/AKT, RAS/MAP-kinase, SRC and STAT signaling cascades, among others (PMID: 9130710, 10220407,19208461, 11252954). Mutations distributed throughout the entire ERBB4 gene have been identified at moderate to low frequencies (<20%) with no veritable hotspots in a variety of tissue types, including melanoma (PMID: 22817889, 22842228, 19718025, 24755198), lung (PMID: 18948947), gastric (PMID: 25079317, 25583476) and colorectal cancers (PMID: 22895193). Evidence in breast cancer cell lines highlights a novel role for ERBB4 in mediating acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibitors (PMID: 25590338). Conversely, a subset of literature points to a growth-suppressive role for ERBB4 in breast cancer (PMID: 17120616, 24791013, 16832345, 20603612). The prognostic value of ERBB4 expression in cancer is still debatable, as reports have documented both better and worse outcomes in these tumors; however, this may be due to the lack of discrimination between ERBB4 variants (PMID: 25492965, 18454307).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2066,"hugoSymbol":"ERBB4","name":"erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000342788","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005235.2","geneAliases":["ALS19","p180erbB4","HER4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25079317","title":"Comprehensive molecular characterization of gastric adenocarcinoma.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2014 Sep 11","volume":"513","issue":"7517","pages":"202-9","authors":"Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature13480","link":null,"reference":"Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network..
