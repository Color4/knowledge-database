[{"evidenceId":13046,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"TET2 belongs to a family of alpha-ketoglutarate and iron-dependent enzymes involved in converting 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (PMID: 19372391). This modification is implicated in active DNA demethylation, a process that is important for cellular reprogramming and gene regulation (PMID: 20639862). TET2 has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor with mutations leading to loss-of-function, particularly those affecting the C-terminal catalytic domain (PMID: 21057493). In animal models, TET2 loss cooperates with other mutations such as JAK2 and FLT3-ITD mutations to promote cancer progression and can induce genomic hypermethylation and increase stem cell self-renewal (PMID:21723200, 25281607, 25873173, 25886910). TET2 mutations are most often found in hematologic malignancies (PMID: 24220273). Isolated mutations in TET2 have also been found in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis but with no apparent hematologic disease (PMID: 23001125). However, these patients are at a higher risk of developing hematologic cancer with aging (PMID: 25426837, 25426838). TET family enzyme activity is also inhibited by specific mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 that produce an inhibitory co-factor, 2-hydroxyglutarate (PMID: 21130701). Mutations in WT1 may also affect TET2 function as an associated co-factor (PMID: 25482556, 25601757).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":54790,"hugoSymbol":"TET2","name":"tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000380013","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001127208.2","geneAliases":["KIAA1546","MDS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"21130701","title":"Leukemic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations result in a hypermethylation phenotype, disrupt TET2 function, and impair hematopoietic differentiation.","journal":"Cancer cell","pubDate":"2010 Dec 14","volume":"18","issue":"6","pages":"553-67","authors":"Figueroa ME et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.015","link":null,"reference":"Figueroa ME et al.
