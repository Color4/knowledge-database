PARP1 is highly expressed in tumors and is composed of three crucial domains (a DNA binding N-terminal domain, a catalytic C-terminal domain, and a central automodification domain) that play a key role in major cellular processes, including DNA repair, DNA replication, transcription, DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling by binding to single-strand breaks (SSBs) and recruiting DNA repair proteins to the damage site. (PMID: 9315851, 26184161) PARP1 is also a key factor in regulating various biological and oncogenic processes, including maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic development, cell reprogramming, transcriptional regulation in tumor growth and progression, and epigenetic modulation in tumorigenesis. (PMID: 17286852, 22902501, 23939864, 21095583, 19262751, 26184161) In the absence PARP1, SSBs cause replication fork collapse, resulting in double-stranded breaks, and ultimately triggering DNA repair by homologous recombination pathways involving genes such as BRCA1/2. Because of its major role in various oncogenic processes, PARP inhibitors have been developed. (PMID: 25286972) Research efforts in the past decade have evaluated the potential utility and efficacy of PARP inhibitors particularly in germline BRCA1/2-mutant cancers. (PMID: 15829967, 19351835, 20858840, 25286972) In addition, effects of PARP inhibitors in other tumor types that share clinicopathological characteristics with BRCA-mutant tumors (‘BRCAness’), such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and ovarian serous papillary carcinoma have been investigated.
