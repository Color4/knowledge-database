[{"evidenceId":18973,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The SPRED1 gene encodes a member of the Sprouty family of proteins. SPRED1 is a negative regulator of the MAP-kinase (MAPK) pathway (PMID: 15683364, 21364986). The mechanism by which SPRED1 inhibits MAPK signaling involves NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), which, upon interaction with SPRED1, localizes to the plasma membrane and facilitates RAS inactivation (PMID: 22751498, 26635368). Overexpression of SPRED1 in a hepatocellular carcinoma model leads to a decrease in cell motility and an increase in the expression of metalloproteinases, which are involved in invasion and metastasis (PMID: 16652141). SPRED1 is rarely mutated in cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016). However, germline loss-of-function mutations in SPRED1 are the cause of Legius syndrome, a familial disorder with neurofibromatosis-like features (PMID: 24334617, 17704776, 19366998).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":161742,"hugoSymbol":"SPRED1","name":"sprouty related EVH1 domain containing 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000299084","curatedRefSeq":"NM_152594.2","geneAliases":["spred-1","NFLS","hSpred1","PPP1R147"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17704776","title":"Germline loss-of-function mutations in SPRED1 cause a neurofibromatosis 1-like phenotype.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2007 Sep","volume":"39","issue":"9","pages":"1120-6","authors":"Brems H et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Brems H et al.
