[{"evidenceId":19315,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The protein FUBP1, binds single-stranded DNA, including regulatory DNA elements upstream of genes. Among the motifs it binds is the far upstream element (FUSE), which is located upstream of the MYC oncogene (PMID: 22926519). Regulation of MYC by FUBP1 is complex; while overexpression of FUBP1 can activate transcription of the MYC gene, it has also been reported that inactivating mutations of FUBP1 activate MYC expression (PMID: 20420426). FUBP1 is also known to bind RNA (PMID: 23818605), e.g. in order to regulate the splicing of MDM2, an important negative regulator of the tumor suppressor TP53 (PMID: 24798327). FUBP1 was reported to be mutated at relatively low frequency (<8%) across a variety of cancers (cBioPortal, Nov 3, 2015). It is most frequently mutated in gliomas, which also show frequent deletion of 1p, where the FUBP1 gene is located (PMID: 22869205, 21817013).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8880,"hugoSymbol":"FUBP1","name":"far upstream element binding protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000370768","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003902.3","geneAliases":["FBP","hDH V","FUBP"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"20420426","title":"Quantitative characterization of the interactions among c-myc transcriptional regulators FUSE, FBP, and FIR.","journal":"Biochemistry","pubDate":"2010 Jun 8","volume":"49","issue":"22","pages":"4620-34","authors":"Hsiao HH et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1021/bi9021445","link":null,"reference":"Hsiao HH et al.
