TC21 islocalized to plasma membrane, and activates the mitogen-activated proteinkinase (MAPK) and JNK signaling cascades via its interaction with c-Raf-1 aswell as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-Akt pathway in order tomediate transformation and differentiation in diverse cell types (PMID: 10557073,11850823). RRas2 mutations in positions analogous to those present in other RAS oncogenes show high levels of transforming activity and also induce transcriptional activation from Ras-responsive promoter elements (PMID: 8196649). Oncogenic mutations in RRAS2 are occasionally found in tumorcell lines (PMID: 8052619, 7478545), and RRAS2 amplification is found in manycell lines derived from breast cancer (PMID: 8552388).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":22800,"hugoSymbol":"RRAS2","name":"related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000256196","curatedRefSeq":"NM_012250.5","geneAliases":["TC21"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11850823","title":"TC21 mediates transformation and cell survival via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and NF-kappaB signaling pathway.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2002 Feb 7","volume":"21","issue":"7","pages":"1062-70","authors":"Rong R et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Rong R et al.
