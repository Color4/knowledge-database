[{"evidenceId":5675,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The BCL10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10) gene encodes an adaptor protein involved in apoptosis and NFkB signaling. BCL10 was discovered at the breakpoint of a recurrent translocation in a subtype of low-grade malignant lymphomas, and subsequent experiments showed its role in apoptosis and NFkB regulation (PMID: 1728948, 9989495, 10319863). The BCL10 protein contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) commonly found in proteins involved in apoptosis and inflammation pathways (PMID: 9989495). BCL10 forms part of the CARD11–BCL10–MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is a regulator of NFkB in lymphocytes following antigen stimulation (PMID: 25087226, 15541657). Mutations in BCL10 have been found at low frequency in lymphomas, germ cell tumors and the MSI-high type of colorectal cancer (PMID: 10819599, 10582682, 11445840).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8915,"hugoSymbol":"BCL10","name":"B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000370580","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003921.4","geneAliases":["c-E10","CIPER","mE10","CLAP","IMD37","CARMEN"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"1728948","title":"Cytogenetic study of B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.","journal":"Cancer genetics and cytogenetics","pubDate":"1992 Jan","volume":"58","issue":"1","pages":"35-8","authors":"Wotherspoon AC et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Wotherspoon AC et al.
