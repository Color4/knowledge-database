The SMAD proteins have an N-terminal MH1 and a C-terminal MH2 domain, the former important for DNA binding and the latter for binding to regulators and effectors, including the TGFß receptors and transcription cofactors (PMID: 12821112, 25935112). SMAD4 binds to two R-SMAD proteins (SMADs 1,2,3,5 and 8/9) after their subsequent phosphorylation by ligand-activated receptor kinases (PMID: 25935112). The SMAD heterotrimer complex translocates to the nucleus to induce transcription of TGFß target genes (PMID: 12191474). Moreover, SMAD4 is itself a target for phosphorylation by intracellular kinases that can both activate and repress its activity (PMID: 12801888, 25373906). The contextual nature of TGFß-dependent transcription allows the TGFß pathway to suppress tumorigenesis in premalignant states and promote invasiveness and metastasis during cancer progression (PMID: 22992590, 18662538, 20495575, 21217753, 21778426, 22167769). SMAD4 has been shown to function as a potent tumor suppressor, and germline mutations in SMAD4 have been associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) (PMID: 9545410, 8553070, 8673134, 18662538). Inactivation of SMAD4 commonly occurs in pancreatic cancer through loss of one or both copies and/or somatic mutations and is associated with tumor grade (PMID: 8553070, 8673134, 9766641, 9135016, 10327057, 19273710, 12821112). Mutations, allelic loss and/or lost expression are observed at lower frequencies in multiple tumor types, including colon, lung adenocarcinoma and head and neck and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 23139211, 19841540, 16959974, 22810696, 15867212, 25589618). Loss of SMAD4 expression has been associated with clinopathological features in lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 25890228).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4089,"hugoSymbol":"SMAD4","name":"SMAD family member 4","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000342988","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005359.5","geneAliases":["JIP","MADH4","MYHRS","DPC4"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"8553070","title":"DPC4, a candidate tumor suppressor gene at human chromosome 18q21.1.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"1996 Jan 19","volume":"271","issue":"5247","pages":"350-3","authors":"Hahn SA et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Hahn SA et al.
