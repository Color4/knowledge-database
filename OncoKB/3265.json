[{"evidenceId":10366,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"HRAS (Harvey Ras) is a membrane-associated GTPase. It plays an important role as an upstream mediator of several pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3 kinase (PI3K) pathways. HRAS, NRAS and KRAS comprise the Ras proto-oncogene family, and all three have a similar structure and function. Transforming, gain-of-function mutations of RAS oncogenes tend to disrupt GTPase activity and promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis (PMID: 12778136). Overexpression of oncogenic HRAS also triggers growth factorâ€“independent cell cycle progression and upregulation of proteins implicated in tumor growth (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9). HRAS mutations are found most commonly in cancers of the thyroid, salivary glands, bladder urinary tract, cervix and prostate (PMID: 21993244, 22589270). Patients with Costello syndrome, a hereditary disorder with germline alterations in HRAS, can develop various malignancies at a young age, including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (PMID: 22261753, 16170316). RAS mutations (including HRAS) have been found in a significant proportion of RET negative medullary thyroid cancer (PMID: 21325462, 23240926, 22865907, 23264394). And while multikinase inhibitors that include HRAS among its targets are FDA-approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, the FDA-approval is not based on the HRAS mutant status, therefore not explicitly meeting the OncoKB Level 1 criteria.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-14","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3265,"hugoSymbol":"HRAS","name":"HRas proto-oncogene, GTPase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000311189","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001130442.1","geneAliases":["C-H-RAS","HAMSV","p21ras","C-BAS/HAS","HRAS1","CTLO","H-RASIDX","C-HA-RAS1","RASH1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21325462","title":"High prevalence of RAS mutations in RET-negative sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas.","journal":"The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","pubDate":"2011 May","volume":"96","issue":"5","pages":"E863-8","authors":"Moura MM et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1210/jc.2010-1921","link":null,"reference":"Moura MM et al.
