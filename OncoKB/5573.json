PRKAR1A belongs to a family of regulatory subunits that binds and inhibits the catalytic subunit of PKA (PMID:15331577). Upon cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binding by PRKAR1A, the catalytic subunit is released to phosphorylate target proteins at serine/theronine sites. Germline mutations in PRKAR1A are responsible for Carney complex characterized by skin pigmented lesions, myxomas, collagenomas, and fibromas (PMID:10973256) and for primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease leading to Cushing's syndrome (PMID:17036196,12424709). Deletions and loss of function mutations have been identified in adrenocortical tumors (PMID:14500362).
