[{"evidenceId":19423,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MGA gene encodes the MAX-gene associated protein (MGA), a dual-specificity transcription factor that regulates the expression of MAX-target genes and T-box family target genes. MAX is a transcription factor that heterodimierizes with other basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family members, including MYC and MXI1, to regulate the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation. As part of this network, MGA contains a MYC-like bHLHZip motif and heterodimerize with MAX to bind to MYC-MAX DNA binding sites (PMID: 10601024). MGA contains a second DNA-binding domain, known as the T-domain, that binds to genes containing Brachyury-binding sites. In vitro studies demonstrated that MGA can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor, and transcriptional activation is dependent on MAX (PMID: 10601024). MGA loss of function mutations have been observed in lung cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, and are mutually exclusive with MYC amplifications (PMID: 25079552, 26192917, 23039309, 23047824).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-06","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":23269,"hugoSymbol":"MGA","name":"MGA, MAX dimerization protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000219905","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001164273.1","geneAliases":["MAD5","MXD5"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"23039309","title":"MGA, a suppressor of MYC, is recurrently inactivated in high risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","journal":"Leukemia &amp; lymphoma","pubDate":"2013 May","volume":"54","issue":"5","pages":"1087-90","authors":"De Paoli L et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.723706","link":null,"reference":"De Paoli L et al.
