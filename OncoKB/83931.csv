18600,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"STK40 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 40) encodes a protein that contains a serine/threonine protein kinase domain (aa52–326) flanked by short N- and C-terminal fragments and is a negative regulator of NF-κB- and p53-mediated transcription (PMID:26663584,13679039). Overexpression of STK40 inhibits NF-κB activation triggered by TNF in experiments with transfected 293 cells (PMID:13679039). Moreover STK40 inhibits p53-mediated transcription in a manner dependent on its kinase activity, because the point mutant of STK40, wherein the conserved aspartic acid (D197) in the putative catalytic pocket is mutated to isoleucine potentiates p53-mediated transcription (PMID:13679039). STK40 contains two conserved potential binding sites for miR-31 and that binding directly regulates STK40 expression (PMID:25568668). miR-31 is a pleiotropic molecule that can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in different cancer types, although it is usually classified as a tumor suppressor. miR-31, is underexpressed in both primary cancers and established cancer cell lines and is the most underexpressed miRNA in serous ovarian cancer, suggesting tumor suppressive function (PMID:20179198). On the other hand, overexpression of miR-31 is implicated in the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID:26286729). The role of STK40, a a direct target of miR-31, has just started being elucidated, but the reports so far indicate that its expression is deregulated in ovarian cancer cells and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.STK40 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 40) encodes a protein that is a negative regulator of NF-κB- and p53-mediated transcription (PMID:26663584,13679039).Overexpression of STK40 inhibits NF-κB activation triggered by TNF in experiments with transfected 293 cells (PMID:13679039).
