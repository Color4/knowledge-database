[{"evidenceId":17651,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CYSLTR2 gene encodes the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family. CYSLTR2 is one of the receptors activated by Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), which are inflammatory lipid mediators synthesized by a variety of cells and involved in allergic processes (PMID: 16776669, 13679572). CYSLTR2 modulates endothelial permeability and signals through the calcium/PKC pathway (PMID: 15545522, 25839425). CYSLTR2 might play a role in colon cancer (PMID: 21203429, 23829413). CYSLTR2 is rarely mutated in cancers, but it is deleted in a subset of prostate carcinomas (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":57105,"hugoSymbol":"CYSLTR2","name":"cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000282018","curatedRefSeq":"NM_020377.2","geneAliases":["HG57","CYSLT2R","HPN321","GPCR21","KPG_011","hGPCR21","CYSLT2","PSEC0146"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21203429","title":"Ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 triggers internalization and signaling in intestinal epithelial cells.","journal":"PloS one","pubDate":"2010 Dec 28","volume":"5","issue":"12","pages":"e14439","authors":"Parhamifar L et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0014439","link":null,"reference":"Parhamifar L et al.
