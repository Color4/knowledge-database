2204,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"The FGFR4 gene encodes the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4, a receptor tyrosine kinase. The FGFR4 protein interacts with and is stimulated by its cognate ligand fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) resulting in its change of conformation and consequent activation of downstream pathways, which regulate cell division and differentiation. Several genetic alterations in FGFR4 have been described in cancers, including amplification and somatic point mutations (PMID: 20094046). These alterations lead to increased receptor signaling, resulting in increased cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis.",,2017-08-02,,2264,FGFR4,fibroblast growth factor receptor 4,True,ENST00000292408,NM_213647.1,JTK2,CD334,TKF,False,20094046,Fibroblast growth factor signalling: from development to cancer.,Nature reviews.
