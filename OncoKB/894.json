Upon complexing with CCND1, CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (RB), thus leading to the induction of a gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors (PMID: 12432268). However, CCND2 (like CCND1 and CCND3) is not essential for entry into the cell cycle (PMID: 15315760). Unlike CCND1, CCND2 is rarely amplified in human cancers. CCND2 over-expression has been reported in a small proportion (<10%) of mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) that lack translocations involving CCND1-Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) juxtaposition; and in approximately 2% of gliomas. Conversely, CCND2 is frequently methylated, with loss of Cyclin D2 protein expression in pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancer (PMID: 21734724). Given the strong link between aberrant CDK4/6 activity and cancer cell proliferation, therapeutics targeting CDK4/6 complexes have been intensely investigated. In 2015, the first CDK4/6 inhibitor was FDA-approved for the treatment of breast cancer (fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm432886; June 2015); and similar ones are currently in clinical trials to treat tumors with CCND1 amplification and other mutations that impact CDK4/6 activity (PMID: 24795392). However, their utility in treating cancers with CCND2 amplification specifically has not been investigated.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":894,"hugoSymbol":"CCND2","name":"cyclin D2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000261254","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001759.3","geneAliases":["MPPH3","KIAK0002"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8114739","title":"Identification of G1 kinase activity for cdk6, a novel cyclin D partner.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"1994 Mar","volume":"14","issue":"3","pages":"2077-86","authors":"Meyerson M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Meyerson M et al.
