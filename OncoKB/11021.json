[{"evidenceId":18639,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RAB35 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that collectively function in regulating the myriad of membrane transport processes in eukaryotic cells (PMID: 19931531, 20937701, 23060965). RAB35 (also named Ray or Rab1c), interacts with p53-related protein kinase and distributes in the nucleus, cytosol, and cell membrane of HeLa cells (PMID: 16600182). RAB35 is an interacting partner for nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase ((NPM-ALK) in human lymphoma cells (PMID:14968112) and mediates Wnt5a-induced migration of breast cancer cells MCF-7 (PMID:23353182). Through mutual antagonism, RAB35 and ARF6 are geared to reciprocally balance the recycling of integrins and cadherins in order to tune cell adhesive behavior towards cell migration or intercellular contact. Consistent with that, there is a strong reduction in RAB35 expression levels in brain, breast and squamous tumors, which are all associated with EGF receptor overexpression and enhanced ARF6 activity (PMID: 23264734). A clinical investigation demonstrates a significant positive correlation between RAB35 and androgen receptor (AR) expression in ovarian cancer, making RAB35 attractive as a candidate for biomarker of AR function in ovarian cancer (PMID:19623182). Importantly, RAB35 is a critical regulator of PI3Kâ€“AKT signaling that acts upstream of PDK1 and mTORC2 and downstream of growth factor receptors (PMID:26338797). Expression of two known cancer-related RAB35 missense mutations, RAB35-A151T or RAB35-F161L, resulted in increased AKT phosphorylation, enhanced cell viability, resistance to apoptosis under growth-factor deprivation, and PI3K-dependent transformation, indicative of a gain-of-function effect(PMID: 26338797). Searches of existing human tumor sequencing databases reveal that RAB35 mutations are rare and are therefore unlikely to appear on current lists of human cancer genes that rely solely on statistical methods to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations (PMID: 26338797). Finally, RAB35 is a target gene of miR-720 in HEK293T and HeLa cells, a nonclassical miRNA involved in the initiation and progression of several tumors (PMID:26413265).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":11021,"hugoSymbol":"RAB35","name":"RAB35, member RAS oncogene family","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000229340","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006861.6","geneAliases":["H-ray","RAY"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23353182","title":"Rab35 is required for Wnt5a/Dvl2-induced Rac1 activation and cell migration in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.","journal":"Cellular signalling","pubDate":"2013 May","volume":"25","issue":"5","pages":"1075-85","authors":"Zhu Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.01.015","link":null,"reference":"Zhu Y et al.
