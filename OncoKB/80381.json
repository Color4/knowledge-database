B7-H3 is a transmembrane protein found in various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and osteoclast. Additionally, B7-H3 is expressed in immune cells, particularly antigen presenting cells. It is expected to play a role in T-cell mediated immmune response (PMID: 27208063, 22437870). B7-H3 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and has been associated with disease spread and poor prognosis (PMID: 24892449, 22473715, 16489649, 18042703).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":80381,"hugoSymbol":"CD276","name":"CD276 molecule","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000318443","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001024736.1","geneAliases":["B7RP-2","B7-H3","4Ig-B7-H3","B7H3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16489649","title":"Relationship between co-stimulatory molecule B7-H3 expression and gastric carcinoma histology and prognosis.","journal":"World journal of gastroenterology","pubDate":"2006 Jan 21","volume":"12","issue":"3","pages":"457-9","authors":"Wu CP et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Wu CP et al.
