In response to DNA damage, CHEK2 is activated via phosphorylation and mediates signaling that leads to a variety of cellular responses, including cell cycle checkpoint activation, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair and/or apoptosis (PMID: 25404613). These responses prevent damaged cells from continuing through the cell cycle or proliferating. CHEK2 also plays an important role during mitosis by maintaining chromosomal stability (PMID: 24798733, 20364141). Given its role in maintaining genomic stability, CHEK2 alterations are found in a range of cancers including glioblastoma, breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, gastric, thyroid, and lung cancer (PMID: 23296741, 24713400, 25583358, 12052256, 15125777). Despite having potent tumor suppressive function, studies have investigated using selective CHEK2 inhibitors (e.g. rabusertib) alone or in combination with other agents to sensitize tumor cells already treated with genotoxic agents (PMID: 21458083, 11557032). Nevertheless, therapeutic inhibition of CHEK2 is controversial due to its important tumor suppressive function in mitosis and the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (PMID: 21088254).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":11200,"hugoSymbol":"CHEK2","name":"checkpoint kinase 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000328354","curatedRefSeq":"NM_007194.3","geneAliases":["HuCds1","RAD53","CHK2","PP1425","LFS2","hCds1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12052256","title":"Mutation analysis of the CHK2 gene in breast carcinoma and other cancers.","journal":"Breast cancer research : BCR","pubDate":"2002","volume":"4","issue":"3","pages":"R4","authors":"Ingvarsson S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Ingvarsson S et al.
