[{"evidenceId":19502,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"MALT1 encodes for a mucosal associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1, a cystein paracaspase. It cleaves multiple substrates including BCL10, RELB, and TNFAIP3, and promotes NFkB signaling (PMID:21873235,18223652,18264101). It associates with CARMA1 and BCL10 to form a complex (CBM) with scaffold function to recruit proteins important for signaling (PMID:24074955, 15125833). MALT1 activity is employed in B-cell and T-cell antigen receptor activation and IL2 production (PMID:23706741, 14614861, 14576442). Germline mutation can lead to immunodeficiency (PMID:25627829, 23727036). MALT1 is translocated with partner API2 in Muscosal associated B-cell lymphomas (PMID:10339464). The fusion protein causes dimerization and activation of NFkB (PMID:11262391). MALT1 can also be amplified or overexpressed by translocation with the IgH chain locus in non-Hodgkins lymphomas (PMID:12560219). MALT1 activity was found to be critical for the growth of activated B-cell type Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) (PMID:19897720). Inhibitors of MALT1 proteolytic activity are in development for lymphoma therapy (PMID:23238016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10892,"hugoSymbol":"MALT1","name":"MALT1 paracaspase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000348428","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006785.3","geneAliases":["MLT","PCASP1","MLT1","IMD12"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12560219","title":"MALT1 is deregulated by both chromosomal translocation and amplification in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2003 Jun 1","volume":"101","issue":"11","pages":"4539-46","authors":"Sanchez-Izquierdo D et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sanchez-Izquierdo D et al.
