[{"evidenceId":19579,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"Insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is one of the mediators of Insulin receptor (INSR) signalling in cells (PMID: 1648180, 19029956). Upon activation of INSR, IRS2 is phosphorylated and activated leading to the activation of the AKT and MAPK pathway (PMID: 1648180, 11292874, 21597332, 24810113). Dysregulation or IRS2 leads to obesity and diabetes and IRS2 deficiency impairs brain growth (PMID: 15467829, 12904469). IRS1 has oncogenic functions in multiple tumor entities such as squamous cell carcinoma and high IRS1 expression is associated with adverse prognosis (PMID: 24810113, 17030631, 22337149). Nedd4-induced ubiquitination or IRS2 enhances IGF signalling and its mitotic activity (PMID: 25879670). IRS2 amplifications have been observed in colorectal cancer which result in increased susceptibility to anti-EGFR therapy (PMID: 26416732).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-10","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8660,"hugoSymbol":"IRS2","name":"insulin receptor substrate 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000375856","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003749.2","geneAliases":["IRS-2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19029956","title":"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor signalling in neoplasia.","journal":"Nature reviews.
