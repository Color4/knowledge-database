AMER1 also functions as a negative regulator of WNT/β-catenin signaling (PMID: 21248786, 17510365, 20843316). In this capacity, AMER1 acts as a scaffold protein by assembling β-catenin and members of the destruction complex at the plasma membrane, which is necessary for β-catenin degradation (PMID: 17510365, 21498506). The AMER1 gene is mutated in approximately 5-10% of Wilms tumors, a pediatric kidney cancer (PMID: 17204608, 21248786, 19137020, 18311776, 26274016). Missense and truncating AMER1 mutations are found in approximately 7-10% of colorectal cancers and correlate with reduced WNT signaling (PMID: 26071483). This data is consistent with AMER1 functioning as a tumor suppressor, as loss of AMER1 results in activation of WNT/ β-catenin signaling (PMID: 17510365, 17510365).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":139285,"hugoSymbol":"AMER1","name":"APC membrane recruitment protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000330258","curatedRefSeq":"NM_152424.3","geneAliases":["FAM123B","OSCS","WTX"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"17925383","title":"AMER1 regulates the distribution of the tumor suppressor APC between microtubules and the plasma membrane.","journal":"Journal of cell science","pubDate":"2007 Nov 1","volume":"120","issue":"Pt 21","pages":"3738-47","authors":"Grohmann A et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Grohmann A et al.
