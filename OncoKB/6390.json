[{"evidenceId":2670,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) , also called mitochondrial complex II, is a heterotetramer protein complex consisting of four subunits, including SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD. SDHA and SDHB form the catalytic domain, while SDHC and SDHD anchor the complex to the inner mitochondrial membrane (PMID: 10657297). SDH is the only enzyme involved in both the electron transport chain and the TCA cycle, where it catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. SDH mutations have been involved in the pathogenesis of pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), renal-cell carcinomas, and pituitary adenomas (PMID: 25394176). Defects in the SDH inhibit prolyl hydroxylases, leading to decreased hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF-1α). It also causes an accumulation of succinate and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which, among other things, results in stabilization of HIF-1α. These results in activation of the hypoxia pathway, which supports tumor formation by activating angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, cell motility, and cell survival (PMID: 18978332). The accumulation of succinate can inhibit α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes, for example, the TET family of DNA hydroxylases. Inhibition of TET activity may, in turn, alter global DNA methylation and gene expression in SDH-deficient tumors. (PMID: 23743927)Pheochromocytomas/ParagangliomasHereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma Syndrome is an inherited autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome. Individuals with a germline mutation in any of the SDH family genes are considered to be at an increased risk of developing PCCs, PGLs or both. These tumors stem from neural crest cells and hence are considered neuro-endocrine tumors. In total, 211 different SDHB germline mutations have been described in PCCs/PGLs (PMID: 25394176). The majority are missense mutations. One somatic missense mutation has been identified in SDHB (c.299C>T, p.S100F) (PMID: 17639058). Fifty-nine mutations were described in malignant tumors. No hotspot mutations were related to malignant behavior. SDHB PGLs are more commonly located in the abdomen and mediastinum than in the head and neck. A review of 1,700 cases suggested a lifetime penetrance of 77% (PMID: 22041710). The rate of malignancy is higher with SDHB than with the other SDH genes, with up to one-third of patients having malignant tumors in most series (PMID: 15328326; 19802898). SDHB germline mutation was associated with hypermethylation of the O⁶-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter and low silencing of MGMT expression. In patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, SDHB mutations are associated with response to temozolomide, an oral alternative to dacarbazine(PMID: 24752622). Overall, children with PCC have an excellent long-term prognosis. However, SDHB mutations are associated with more aggressive disease with early age at diagnosis, higher metastatic potential, recurrence and the development of other primary malignancies (PCC, PGL, and RCC) (PMID: 21969497)Gastrointestinal stromal tumors, renal-cell carcinomas, and pituitary adenomas Fourteen SDHB germline mutations were identified in the GISTs, with missense mutations the most frequent type. Twenty-five SDHB germline mutations were identified in the RCCs, the majority of which are missense type mutations. Two SDHB germline mutations were reported in PAs. There are no somatic-type SDHB mutations identified (PMID: 25394176).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6390,"hugoSymbol":"SDHB","name":"succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000375499","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003000.2","geneAliases":["SDH","IP","PGL4","CWS2","SDH1","SDH2","SDHIP"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22041710","title":"Genetics and clinical characteristics of hereditary pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.","journal":"Endocrine-related cancer","pubDate":"2011 Dec","volume":"18","issue":"6","pages":"R253-76","authors":"Welander J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1530/ERC-11-0170","link":null,"reference":"Welander J et al.
