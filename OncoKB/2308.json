FOXO1 was originally called FKHR (forkhead in rhabdomyosarcomas). The gene was identified in studies of the t(2,13)(q35;q14) and t(1,13)(p36;q14) chromosomal translocations commonly found in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a skeletal-muscle tumor that is prevalent in children (PMID: 17646672, 8275086). FoxO proteins can regulate cell fate by modulating the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle transitions, DNA repair, oxidative stress and longevity, and control of muscle growth, as well as cell differentiation and glucose metabolism (PMID: 15137936, 15860415, 16288288, 17646672). FOXO proteins is phosphorylated by Akt at three sites (threonine 24, serine 256 and serine 319) (PMID: 17646672). The dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase (DYRK) phosphorylates FoxO1 at a novel phosphorylation site, serine 329 which decreases the transcriptional activity of FoxO1 (PMID: 11311120). FoxO1 can also be phosphorylated by CDK2 primarily at serine 249 in vitro and in vivo (PMID:17038621). CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO1 not only decreases the basal transcriptional activity of FoxO1 but also overcomes PTEN-induced activation of FoxO1. FOXO1 deletions are found in prostate cancers.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2308,"hugoSymbol":"FOXO1","name":"forkhead box O1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000379561","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002015.3","geneAliases":["FOXO1A","FKH1","FKHR"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16288288","title":"FOXO transcription factors at the interface between longevity and tumor suppression.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2005 Nov 14","volume":"24","issue":"50","pages":"7410-25","authors":"Greer EL et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Greer EL et al.
