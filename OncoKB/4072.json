It functions as a transmembrane glycoprotein that specifically mediates epithelial specific intercellular cell-adhesion (PMID: 21576002). Germline deletions in the EpCAM gene cause Lynch syndrome via epigenetic silencing of MSH2 (MutS protein homolog 2), leading to a predisposition to colorectal and endometrial cancers (PMID: 19098912). EpCAM is also overexpressed in certain types of solid tumors, though its role in this setting is not fully understood. The bi-specific antibody catumaxomab targets both EpCAM and the T-cell antigen CD3 in an attempt to recruit and activate immune effector cells at the tumor site (PMID: 11588051), and is approved for malignant ascites in patients with EpCAM-positive cancers (PMID: 20473913).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4072,"hugoSymbol":"EPCAM","name":"epithelial cell adhesion molecule","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263735","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002354.2","geneAliases":["HNPCC8","EGP314","M4S1","MK-1","EGP40","KS1/4","TACSTD1","MIC18","ESA","TROP1","KSA","EGP-2","DIAR5"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11588051","title":"Induction of a long-lasting antitumor immunity by a trifunctional bispecific antibody.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2001 Oct 15","volume":"98","issue":"8","pages":"2526-34","authors":"Ruf P et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Ruf P et al.
