NTRK2 consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular region harboring the tyrosine kinase domain. Normal activation in neural cells occurs upon binding one of its three ligands, the nerve growth factor (NGF), the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), leading to autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways controlling and promoting cell proliferation, survival and differentiation via MAPK, PI3K and PLC-Î³ (PMID: 1649702, 1649703, 10851172). NTRK2 alterations, especially fusions, are found in several human cancers, such as lung cancer, pilocytic astrocytoma, and neuroblastoma (PMID: 25204415, 21242122, 23817572, 8264643, 9049830).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4915,"hugoSymbol":"NTRK2","name":"neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000277120","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006180.3","geneAliases":["TRKB","GP145-TrkB","trk-B"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8402890","title":"Targeted disruption of the trkB neurotrophin receptor gene results in nervous system lesions and neonatal death.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"1993 Oct 8","volume":"75","issue":"1","pages":"113-22","authors":"Klein R et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Klein R et al.
