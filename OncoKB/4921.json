[{"evidenceId":11832,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The DDR2 gene encodes the Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). When the extracellular discoidin domain of the receptor is bound by its cognate ligand, collagen, autophosphorylation of the DDR2 intracellular kinase domain is initiated, which results in activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Activation of these pathways promote cellular migration, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 16186108, 17703188, 16626936). Additionally, alteration of DDR2 activation or expression has been implicated in metastasis of various cancer types, such as colorectal cancer, melanoma and breast cancer (PMID: 22071959, 21735168, 21701781, 23644467, 25130389 though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet fully understood. Mutations in DDR2 have been identified in 2% to 4% of squamous cell lung cancers (PMID: 22768234, 22328973) and at lower frequencies in other cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, May 2015). Clinical responses to targeted therapy with dasatinib have been reported in patients with squamous cell lung cancer with DDR2 mutations (PMID: 22328973). Numerous DDR2 mutations have been reported (PMID: 22328973), both in the kinase domain (563-849), in the discoidin domain and elsewhere in the gene. The impact of each DDR2 point mutation has yet to be fully characterized and each may have unique characteristics with regard to function and potential responsiveness to targeted therapies.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-20","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4921,"hugoSymbol":"DDR2","name":"discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000367921","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006182.2","geneAliases":["NTRKR3","MIG20a","TYRO10"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21735168","title":"The colorectal tumor microenvironment: the next decade.","journal":"Cancer microenvironment : official journal of the International Cancer Microenvironment Society","pubDate":"2011 Aug","volume":"4","issue":"2","pages":"181-5","authors":"Beauchemin N","elocationId":"doi: 10.1007/s12307-011-0074-7","link":null,"reference":"Beauchemin N.
