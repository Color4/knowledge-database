[{"evidenceId":1230,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"EGFR encodes the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. Binding of EGFR by its ligands, which includes Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Transforming Growth Factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), activates downstream signaling pathways including the canonical oncogenic MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades, ultimately resulting in changes in cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (PMID: 18045542). While EGFR usually is expressed at low levels in normal adult tissues, hyperactivation of this receptor by mutations and/or amplification of the EGFR gene is found in many cancer types such as lung, brain, colorectal and head and neck cancer (PMID: 10880430). In brain and colorectal cancers, copy number amplification of the EGFR gene results in receptor overexpression (PMID: 11426640). However, in lung cancer, the most prevalent EGFR alterations are mutations in the kinase domain resulting in a constitutively activated form of the receptor (PMID: 15329413). Activating mutations in EGFR are rarely found in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and colorectal cancer (PMID: 24827134).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-07-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1956,"hugoSymbol":"EGFR","name":"epidermal growth factor receptor","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000275493","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005228.3","geneAliases":["PIG61","ERBB1","mENA","ERBB","HER1","NISBD2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15329413","title":"EGF receptor gene mutations are common in lung cancers from \"never smokers\" and are associated with sensitivity of tumors to gefitinib and erlotinib.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2004 Sep 7","volume":"101","issue":"36","pages":"13306-11","authors":"Pao W et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Pao W et al.
