It is expressed widely throughout the body and regulates multiple developmental processes, such as embryonal cell-fate determination, chondrogenesis and testis formation; however, SOX9 also functions in developed tissues (PMID: 25685828). SOX9 is a transcriptional target of the WNT pathway, but also functions as a regulator of WNT pathway target genes (PMID: 17698607). Additionally, SOX9 can facilitate Î²-catenin degradation by promoting its phosphorylation (PMID: 19047045). Due to its role in development, deleterious mutations of SOX9 can cause developmental disorders; mutations of SOX9 are also implicated in various other disorders (PMID: 25685828). SOX9 mutations are frequent in colorectal cancer and dysregulation of SOX9 is implicated in cancer development in multiple tissue types (PMID: 22810696, 24302456, 22246670, 15084848, 20049725).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-13","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6662,"hugoSymbol":"SOX9","name":"SRY-box 9","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000245479","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000346.3","geneAliases":["SRXY10","CMPD1","CMD1","SRXX2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17698607","title":"Sox9 regulates cell proliferation and is required for Paneth cell differentiation in the intestinal epithelium.","journal":"The Journal of cell biology","pubDate":"2007 Aug 13","volume":"178","issue":"4","pages":"635-48","authors":"Bastide P et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Bastide P et al.
