PP2A activity has long been considered an important tumor suppressor (PMID: 2153055), although recent evidence suggests that it may function as an oncogene in some context (PMID: 27272709). The PPP2R1A gene encodes the 'scaffolding' subunit of the PP2A trimeric holoenzyme, so named because it bridges PP2A's catalytic subunit to a myriad of targeting subunits (PMID: 17055435). Targeting subunits confer specificity for substrate selection and enzyme localization in the cell. PPP2R1A mutations have recently been found to positively correlate with whole-genome doublings in human cancers (PMID: 24071852). These mutations have been identified in uterine (endometrial) carcinomas (PMID: 23636398, 21435433, 21381030, 21435433), uterine (serous) carcinomas (PMID: 21435433) , ovarian low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous carcinomas (PMID: 21435433, 20826764, 21381030). The functional impact of these mutations during tumorigenesis is limited, however, the available studies describing these mutations indicate that normal function of PPP2R1A is tumor suppressive (PMID: 22262169, PMID: 21791616).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5518,"hugoSymbol":"PPP2R1A","name":"protein phosphatase 2 scaffold subunit Aalpha","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000322088","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014225.5","geneAliases":["MRD36","PP2AAALPHA","PP2A-Aalpha","PR65A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21791616","title":"Human cancer-associated mutations in the Aα subunit of protein phosphatase 2A increase lung cancer incidence in Aα knock-in and knockout mice.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"2011 Sep","volume":"31","issue":"18","pages":"3832-44","authors":"Ruediger R et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1128/MCB.05744-11","link":null,"reference":"Ruediger R et al.
