PIK3C2G acts as a lipid kinase to create phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), which acts as a secondary messenger in key signaling pathways involved in cell cycle, motility, differentiation and transformation (PMID: 10209156). Class II PI3Ks are the least studied, however, they are defined by the presence of a carboxyl-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding motif (PMID: 22507127). PIK3C2G is mutated in a number of cancers, and a large proportion of these mutations are predicted to be inactivating mutations.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5288,"hugoSymbol":"PIK3C2G","name":"phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 gamma","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000266497","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004570.4","geneAliases":["PI3K-C2GAMMA","PI3K-C2-gamma"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25785104","title":"PIK3C2G copy number is associated with clinical outcomes of colorectal cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin.","journal":"International journal of clinical and experimental medicine","pubDate":"2015","volume":"8","issue":"1","pages":"1137-43","authors":"Li A et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Li A et al.
