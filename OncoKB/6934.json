A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within this gene, rs7903146, is the most significant genetic marker associated with Type 2 diabetes risk (PMID: 22872755) and gestational diabetes (PMID: 23690305). TCF7L2 is thought to act as a tumor suppressor by suppressing cell growth-promoting genes (PMID: 18621708). Its frameshift mutation has been implicated in colorectal cancer (PMID 18398040, 18478343). Variants of the gene are most likely involved in many other cancer types (PMID 18621708).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6934,"hugoSymbol":"TCF7L2","name":"transcription factor 7 like 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000543371","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001146274.1","geneAliases":["TCF-4"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"18621708","title":"A genome-wide RNAi screen for Wnt/beta-catenin pathway components identifies unexpected roles for TCF transcription factors in cancer.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2008 Jul 15","volume":"105","issue":"28","pages":"9697-702","authors":"Tang W et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.0804709105","link":null,"reference":"Tang W et al.
