AKT2, along with closely related AKT1 and AKT3, are members of the AGC kinase family. Effects of AKT activation include cell cycle progression and increased migration, differentiation and glucose homeostasis (PMID: 12094235). AKT2 activation occurs when its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) dislodges from the kinase domain (KD), localizes to the cell membrane, and several of its key residues become phosphorylated (PMID: 9374542). AKT2 is an oncogene that is activated in numerous cancers, mostly through amplification of the 19q13.1-q13.2 chromosomal region (PMID: 1409633, 9496907) or overexpression (PMID: 11756242), which promote invasion and metastasis (PMID: 12517798). Germline autosomal dominant mutations in AKT2 are associated with familial diabetes mellitus in humans (PMID: 15166380). There are numerous drugs that target the PI3K/AKT pathway, including inhibitors of AKT itself, and inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR (PMID: 19629070).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-11","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":208,"hugoSymbol":"AKT2","name":"AKT serine/threonine kinase 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000392038","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001626.4","geneAliases":["HIHGHH","PRKBB","PKBBETA","RAC-BETA","PKBB"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15166380","title":"A family with severe insulin resistance and diabetes due to a mutation in AKT2.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2004 May 28","volume":"304","issue":"5675","pages":"1325-8","authors":"George S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"George S et al.
