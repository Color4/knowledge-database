CTCF can recruit histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs), along with other cofactors, and activate or repress transcription, respectively (PMID: 11525835,10734189). c-MYC oncogene is a well known CTCF target, which acts in this context as a transcriptional repressor (PMID: 8649389). CTCF also acts as an insulator, playing a role in high order chromatin structural organization and long-range genomic interactions (PMID: 23498937), typically isolating enhancers from promoters which ultimately results in inhibition of gene transcription (PMID: 19846290, 25002401). Insulation is achieved by CTCF-mediated modification of epigenetic marks, such as H3K27me3 removal (PMID: 25294833). CTCF binding prevents CpG methylation and vice versa (PMID: 20591991, 25703332). Mutations in the CTCF gene usually result in a truncated protein, and they are mainly found in carcinomas of the endometrium (15%), digestive tract (colon and stomach, around 5%) and breast (cBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2015). In addition, both CTCF loss and overexpression lead to global effects in expression profiles.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10664,"hugoSymbol":"CTCF","name":"CCCTC-binding factor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000264010","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006565.3","geneAliases":["MRD21"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25294833","title":"CTCF induces histone variant incorporation, erases the H3K27me3 histone mark and opens chromatin.","journal":"Nucleic acids research","pubDate":"2014 Oct 29","volume":"42","issue":"19","pages":"11941-51","authors":"Weth O et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1093/nar/gku937","link":null,"reference":"Weth O et al.
