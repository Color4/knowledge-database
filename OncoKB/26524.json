The human LATS2 gene was mapped onto chromosome 13q11-12 (PMID:10673337). A frequent LOH of this locus has also been reported in various cancers including breast, ovary, and liver (PMID:3388033, 1655245, 2904349). Overexpression of LATS2 causes G1-S arrest through the inhibition of cyclin E/CDK2 in vitro as well as suppresses the tumorigenicity of NIH/v-ras-transformed cells in vivo. Malignant mesothelioma was demonstrated to have suppressed LATS2 levels (PMID:21245096).In the central axis of Hippo pathway, LATS2 is phosphorylated by MST1/2 at Ser-872 and Thr-1041, and the phosphorylation is enhanced by the presence of MOB1, a regulator of Hippo pathway. Ser-380 of LATS2 can be phosphorylated by Aurora A, a regulator of cell division (PMID: 15688006, 16674920, 18328708). KIBRA is another regulator that stabilizes the LATS2 by inhibiting its ubiquitination, and KIBRA overexpression could also promote YAP phosphorylation through LATS2 (PMID:21233212). At the mRNA level, LATS2 transcripts are regulated by several microRNAs. MiR-372 and miR-373 were reported to exert their oncogenic potentials by targeting LATS2 in testicular germ cell tumors (PMID: 16564011). miR-31 is another microRNA that targets LATS2, as shown in lung cancer (PMID: 20237410).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":26524,"hugoSymbol":"LATS2","name":"large tumor suppressor kinase 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000382592","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014572.2","geneAliases":["KPM"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"10673337","title":"Structure, expression, and chromosome mapping of LATS2, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene lats/warts.","journal":"Genomics","pubDate":"2000 Jan 15","volume":"63","issue":"2","pages":"263-70","authors":"Yabuta N et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Yabuta N et al.
