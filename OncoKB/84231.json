TRAF7 appears to be an inhibitor of NF-kB activation and an agonist for the JNK-AP1 pathway (PMID:15001576,14743216). TRAF7 targets ubiquitination of c-FLIP, an antiapoptotic molecule, as well as p53 and TRAF7 downregulation is found in breast tumors, correlating with the high levels of p53 (PMID:14743216, 23128672). The TRAF7 gene was found as recurrently altered in meningiomas. TRAF7 mutations, which were always exclusive of NF2 mutations (frequently mutated in meningiomas, 36%) were observed in nearly one-fourth of the meningiomas examined (n = 72). It is notable that 67 of the 72 TRAF7 mutations, including 15 recurrent mutations, all map to the WD40 domains (PMID:23348505). TRAF7 mutations are present in 93% of secretory meningiomas (29/30) and are also confined to the seven WD40 domains in the C-terminal portion spanning exons 13 to 20. In most cases, the TRAF7 alterations resulted in single amino acid substitutions, but two tumors were found to harbor splice site mutations (PMID:23404370). in addition, meningiomas with TRAF7 mutations are almost always characterized by the mutation K409Q in the gene for the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). The combined TRAF7/KLF4 mutation characterizes secretory meningiomas and provides a molecular marker for this grade 1 subtype (PMID:23404370, 25993161). Moreover, exome sequencing of 49 MCCs (merkel cell carcinoma) showed TRAF7 to be mutated in MCPyV (cell polyomavirus) - negative MCCs (PMID:26655088). Finally, the methylation frequency of the TRAF7 gene was remarkably modified by genistein treatment, a soy phytoestrogen, making it a potential target for developing therapeutic agents for prostate cancer, where DNA methylation is significantly associated with tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis (PMID:25831061).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":84231,"hugoSymbol":"TRAF7","name":"TNF receptor associated factor 7","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000326181","curatedRefSeq":"NM_032271.2","geneAliases":["RFWD1","RNF119"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23128672","title":"Downregulation of ubiquitin E3 ligase TNF receptor-associated factor             7 leads to stabilization of p53 in breast cancer.","journal":"Oncology reports","pubDate":"2013 Jan","volume":"29","issue":"1","pages":"283-7","authors":"Wang L et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3892/or.2012.2121","link":null,"reference":"Wang L et al.
