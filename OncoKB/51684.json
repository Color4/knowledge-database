[{"evidenceId":18612,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"SUFU encodes the protein suppressor of fused which is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, one of the key regulators of embryonic development (PMID: 23686138). SUFU can sequester GLI transcription factors in the cytoplasm repressing their activity (PMID: 19055941, 10564661, 10559945). SUFU can repress Wnt signaling by exporting beta-catenin from the nucleus (PMID: 11477086) it also can serve as a point of interaction between the hedgehog and p63 pathways which may be an important part of the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation (PMID: 23686138). SUFU is a tumor-suppressor in which truncating germline or somatic mutations, often accompanied by loss of the wildtype allele, are strongly associated with pediatric medulloblastoma (PMID: 12068298, 24651015). Germline mutations in SUFU can cause Gorlin syndrome (PMID: 25403219). No drugs specifically target SUFU although there are drugs that target the hedgehog signaling pathway (PMID: 23291299).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":51684,"hugoSymbol":"SUFU","name":"SUFU negative regulator of hedgehog signaling","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000369902","curatedRefSeq":"NM_016169.3","geneAliases":["SUFUXL","PRO1280","SUFUH"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23686138","title":"Interaction between the TP63 and SHH pathways is an important determinant of epidermal homeostasis.","journal":"Cell death and differentiation","pubDate":"2013 Aug","volume":"20","issue":"8","pages":"1080-8","authors":"Chari NS et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.41","link":null,"reference":"Chari NS et al.
