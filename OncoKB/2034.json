Under normoxic conditions, EPAS1/HIF2α is hydroxylated on specific prolyl sites and recognized by tumor suppressor VHL, leading to ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome (PMID: 18498744). Under hypoxic conditions, EPAS1/HIF2α escapes degradation and activates genes involved in the hypoxia response, including angiogenesis, glycolysis, apoptosis, proliferation, and growth (PMID: 22089927, 14645546). EPAS1 has shown angiogenic and oncogenic properties in vivo in neuroendocrine tumor models (PMID: 23533246, 26432405). EPAS1 is mutated or amplified in a small subset of cancers. In contrast, in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, rare neuroendocrine tumors in which conditions of pseudo-hypoxia occur, several EPAS1 gain-of-function mutations, affecting key prolyl hydroxylation sites, have been reported (PMID: 22931260, 24741025, 23418310). Although HIF inhibitors have been proposed for cancer treatment, the complex and often contradictory roles of these factors suggests careful evaluation (PMID: 22169972).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2034,"hugoSymbol":"EPAS1","name":"endothelial PAS domain protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263734","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001430.4","geneAliases":["MOP2","PASD2","ECYT4","HIF2A","bHLHe73"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18498744","title":"Oxygen sensing by metazoans: the central role of the HIF hydroxylase pathway.","journal":"Molecular cell","pubDate":"2008 May 23","volume":"30","issue":"4","pages":"393-402","authors":"Kaelin WG Jr et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2008.04.009","link":null,"reference":"Kaelin WG Jr et al.
