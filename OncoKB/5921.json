[{"evidenceId":19128,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RASA1 (Ras p21 protein activator 1) encodes a RAS GAP also known as p120RasGAP (PMID: 3201259). It accelerates the conversion of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP to terminate Ras signaling (PMID: 17540168, 18568040). The absence of RASA1 activity leads to accumulation of GTP-bound RAS and persistent MAP kinase signaling following growth factor stimulation (PMID: 9121432). Somatic alterations in RASA1 map to all regions of the gene, including the C-terminal GAP catalytic domain and the N-terminal tandem SH2-SH3-SH2-PH-C2 domains. The SH2 and SH3 domains have been shown to interact with signaling proteins, including RhoGaps. Statistical analysis of mutational profiles of more than 8,200 tumor data sets identified RASA1 as a candidate driver and a putative tumor-suppressor gene based on a high ratio of inactivating to benign mutations (PMID: 24183448). RASA1 has also been implicated as a potential tumor suppressor in aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and several subtypes of breast cancer (PMID: 25303977, 16570289, 19372580). The highest rates of RASA1 mutations have been reported for prostate adenocarcinoma (13.1%) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (13%) (PMID: 22722839, 25303977). In most cancers somatic alterations in RASA1 are infrequent (e.g. 1.6% across 21 tumor types) (PMID: 24390350). RASA1 plays an essential role in vascular system development, as loss-of-function mutations cause capillary ‘malformation-arteriovenous’ malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) (PMID: 24038909, 22913934).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-05-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5921,"hugoSymbol":"RASA1","name":"RAS p21 protein activator 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000274376","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002890.2","geneAliases":["CM-AVM","PKWS","GAP","p120GAP","p120RASGAP","CMAVM","RASGAP","RASA","p120"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"3201259","title":"Molecular cloning of two types of GAP complementary DNA from human placenta.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"1988 Dec 23","volume":"242","issue":"4886","pages":"1697-700","authors":"Trahey M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Trahey M et al.
