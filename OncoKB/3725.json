[{"evidenceId":12742,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The JUN gene encodes the c-Jun protein that forms the Activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complexdimerization with FOS gene-family members. The AP-1 complex regulates a plethora of cellular process including differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis through transcriptional control of several downstream target genes, including p53, cyclin D1 and EGFR (PMID: 12791272, 10072388, 10790372).In its turn, c-Jun is regulated by phosphorylation, mediated in particularl by the JNK, p38 and WNT signaling pathways for directing cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and migration processes (PMID: 10080190, 16007074, 20231272). AP-1 is a potent transforming factor in multiple experimental models, although anit-oncogenic effects have also been described in specific contexts (PMID: 11988758, 14668816). Although a direct oncogenic role for AP-1 has not been described in human tumors, mechanisms for a putative role have been explored in for example breast cancer cell lines and models of liposarcoma, a tumor type in which c-Jun amplification has been observed (PMID: 17637753, 17418412).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3725,"hugoSymbol":"JUN","name":"Jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000371222","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002228.3","geneAliases":["c-Jun","AP1","AP-1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16007074","title":"Interaction of phosphorylated c-Jun with TCF4 regulates intestinal cancer development.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2005 Sep 8","volume":"437","issue":"7056","pages":"281-5","authors":"Nateri AS et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Nateri AS et al.
