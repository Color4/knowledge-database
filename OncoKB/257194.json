[{"evidenceId":18475,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) encodes a cell adhesion molecule that is primarily localized to cell membrane rafts, especially in cell-to-cell contacting areas. NEGR1 is extracellularly tethered to the membrane using a specialized lipid moiety termed a GPI-anchor, which is attached to the C-terminus of the target protein. NEGR1 and other (GPI)-proteins are highly enriched in lipid raft domains, and are involved in a number of important cellular activities including signaling processes and cell adhesion (PMID: 12440695). Genetic alterations of NGR1 is implicated in human obesity and dyslexia (PMID: 19079261, 23677055). NEGR1 is commonly downregulated in many human cancers (PMID: 21624008), suggesting it may function in the regulation of cell adhesion that is required for the normal cell growth and cell-to-cell communication (PMID: 25057311). On the contrary, pro-tumorigenic roles have been assigned to NEGR1 based on gene expression changes that occur following knockdown of TAZ/YAP or TEADs, or inhibition of TGFβ signaling. NEGR1, synergistically with UCA1, as direct targets of TAZ/YAP, TEAD, and TGFβ, are necessary for maintaining tumorigenic activity in metastatic breast cancer cells (PMID: 24648515). Finally, a study aimed to identify protein biomarkers in urine for early screening detection and monitoring invasive breast cancer progression, found NEGR1 as one of proteins that were significantly different in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared to the normal control subjects (PMID:26544852).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":257194,"hugoSymbol":"NEGR1","name":"neuronal growth regulator 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000357731","curatedRefSeq":"NM_173808.2","geneAliases":["Ntra","DMML2433","IGLON4","KILON"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12440695","title":"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins: structure, function, and cleavage by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.","journal":"Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire","pubDate":"2002","volume":"80","issue":"5","pages":"535-49","authors":"Sharom FJ et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sharom FJ et al.
