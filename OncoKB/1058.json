[{"evidenceId":19726,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CENPA encodes centromere protein A and contains a histone H3 related domain that is important for recruitment to the centromere. CENPA, a component of the modified nucleosome, replaces the histone H3 in the tetrameric core H3-H4 (PMID: 3558482, 20739937, 21478274, 16622419). CENPA was first identified in patients with scleroderma that produced autoantibodies against the protein (PMID: 6966403). Studies using knockout mice showed that CENPA is essential for the correct assembly of proteins at the kinetochore, for centromere activity and for chromosome segregation (PMID: 12906131, 10655499, 15870271). CENPA controls epigenetic mechanisms important for centromere organization and activity during DNA replication and cell division (PMID: 17339380, 9024683). Impaired kinetochore assembly and centromere activity, involving CENPA, can lead to aneuploidy, which can, in turn, lead to the development of cancer (PMID: 15380953). Tissue microarray and qPCR experiments have found increased levels of CENPA mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer and glioblastoma stem cells (PMID: 17535684, 12839935, 26295306). Similarly, overexpression of CENPA can act as a prognostic marker for breast cancer, osteosarcoma and neoplastic germ cells (PMID: 17970049, 24213134, 24440098, 24676531). Copy number alterations in CENPA can serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 22369099). Downregulation of CENPA contributes to methotrexate resistance in osteosarcoma cell lines and is responsible for senescence induced by low doses of doxorubicin in hepatoma cell lines (PMID: 26337976, 15870702).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1058,"hugoSymbol":"CENPA","name":"centromere protein A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000335756","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001809.3","geneAliases":["CenH3","CENP-A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24676531","title":"Integrated analysis of expression profiling data identifies three genes in correlation with poor prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer.","journal":"International journal of oncology","pubDate":"2014 Jun","volume":"44","issue":"6","pages":"2025-33","authors":"Zhang C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2352","link":null,"reference":"Zhang C et al.
