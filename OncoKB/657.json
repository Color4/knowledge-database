[{"evidenceId":4861,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"BMPR1A (bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, type IA) is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor that belongs to the transforming growth-factor β (TGF β) family. BMP receptors receive signals from growth factor and cytokine BMP ligands, and transduce these signals through SMAD and non-SMAD pathways to regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis (PMID: 10712517, 9738456, 19762341). BMPR1A signaling also plays a role in apoptosis, osteoblast function and adipocyte differentiation (PMID: 15090551). Germline mutations of BMPR1A are found in individuals with juvenile polyposis syndrome, juvenile intestinal polyposis and Cowden disease (PMID: 15235019, 11536076). Somatic mutations and deletions of BMPR1A are found across a diverse range of cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Aug. 2017).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-23","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":657,"hugoSymbol":"BMPR1A","name":"bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000372037","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004329.2","geneAliases":["CD292","10q23del","ACVRLK3","ALK3","SKR5"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15235019","title":"The prevalence of MADH4 and BMPR1A mutations in juvenile polyposis and absence of BMPR2, BMPR1B, and ACVR1 mutations.","journal":"Journal of medical genetics","pubDate":"2004 Jul","volume":"41","issue":"7","pages":"484-91","authors":"Howe JR et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Howe JR et al.
