Upon binding to PDGF ligand, the receptor undergoes homodimerization (or heterodimerization with PDGFRα), bringing the intracellular kinase domains into proximity and triggering kinase activation. Downstream signaling pathways include JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, PLCγ, and NF-κB (PMID: 18483217, 20581310). PDGFRB is primarily expressed on cells of mesenchymal origin (e.g. fibroblasts, endothelium) and is involved in organ development, angiogenesis and wound repair (PMID: 7958864, 10375497, 18483217, 20581310). Although PDGFRB plays a role in early hematopoiesis, its role in adult hematopoietic cells is less clear (PMID: 7958864, 11264163). Pathologic overexpression of PDGFRB in hematopoietic cells contributes to neoplastic growth and progression (PMID: 20581310). Although PDGF/PDGFR signaling appears to play an important role in numerous types of solid tumors, mutations, amplifications or translocations/fusions of PDGFRB are relatively rare in most solid tumors (PMID: 18483217).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-27","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5159,"hugoSymbol":"PDGFRB","name":"platelet derived growth factor receptor beta","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000261799","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002609.3","geneAliases":["PDGFR1","KOGS","PDGFR-1","JTK12","PDGFR","IBGC4","IMF1","PENTT","CD140B"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20581310","title":"New insights into the mechanisms of hematopoietic cell transformation by activated receptor tyrosine kinases.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2010 Oct 7","volume":"116","issue":"14","pages":"2429-37","authors":"Toffalini F et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-279752","link":null,"reference":"Toffalini F et al.
