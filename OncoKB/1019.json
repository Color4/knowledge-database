[{"evidenceId":9935,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CDK4 encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase 4, a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the cell cycle G1 to S phase transition. Upon mitogen stimulation, CDK4 forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and cyclin D, which leads to activation of the kinases (PMID: 12432268). The active CDK4/CDK6 complex then phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (RB), thereby inducing the gene expression program (which includes mediators of the cell cycle) regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors. CDK4/6 are in turn negatively regulated by p16INK4a (encoded by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene, CDKN2A) which binds to the catalytic domains of the kinases and interferes with cyclin D and ATP binding (PMID: 9751050, 11124804). As CDK4 is a controller of the cell cycle checkpoint, deregulation of its activity by amplification, activating mutations or inactivating p16INK4a is often observed in cancers. Amplification of CDK4 are often reported in sarcomas, glioblastoma and breast cancers (PMID: 8221695, 8044775, 8586464, 9916925). On the contrary, activating mutations of CDK4 in cancers are very rare, with only a few cases of CDK4 mutations at codon 22 and 24 reported in sporadic/hereditary melanoma and lung carcinoma (PMID: 7652577, 9425228, 11828258).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1019,"hugoSymbol":"CDK4","name":"cyclin dependent kinase 4","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000257904","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000075.3","geneAliases":["PSK-J3","CMM3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8586464","title":"Gene amplification in human gliomas.","journal":"Glia","pubDate":"1995 Nov","volume":"15","issue":"3","pages":"289-96","authors":"Collins VP","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Collins VP.
