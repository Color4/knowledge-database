It does so using a transesterification reaction (PMID: 25693836). Decreased TOP1 activity is believed to be involved in genomic instability and the generation of DNA rearrangements during oncogenesis (PMID: 2902925, 15829965). Improper disentanglement of DNA leads to DNA damage and cell death, especially in rapidly dividing cells (PMID: 4748440, 1653585). This vulnerability is used by topoisomerse inhibitors such as camptothecins, which are in use as chemotherapeutic agents since the 1980s (PMID: 2997227, 16990856, 7850785, 2555920). TOP1 copy number alterations and high expression levels have been reported in various cancers and are believed to result in increased susceptibility towards TOP1 inhibitors (PMID: 25855483, 25615400, 26542057). However, TOP1 mutations confer relative resistance to Topoisomerase inhibitors (PMID: 21619602, 23836376, 11844605, 16546964).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7150,"hugoSymbol":"TOP1","name":"topoisomerase (DNA) I","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000361337","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003286.2","geneAliases":["TOPI"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"12042765","title":"Cellular roles of DNA topoisomerases: a molecular perspective.","journal":"Nature reviews.
