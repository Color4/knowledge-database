CSF1R-mediated signaling is an important regulator of innate immunity. Co-expression of CSF1R and the ligand CSF1 can lead to tumorigenic activity in cancer cells independent of CSF1R overexpression or amplification, suggesting that CSF1R acts as an oncogene (PMID: 22096574). However, loss-of-function CSF1R mutations and splice variants have also been associated with a predisposition for myeloid malignancies (PMID: 18971950). Kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies that target CSF1R have been shown to effectively target CSF1/CSF1R signaling, resulting in a reduction in the number of tumor-associated macrophages, Recent preclinical data suggests that CSF1/CSF1R blockade could improve the efficacy of immunotherapies by enhancing activation of T cells in the tumor microenvironment.
