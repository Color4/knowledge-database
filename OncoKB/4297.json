[{"evidenceId":16568,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"KMT2A encodes the histone methyltransferase MLL1, an epigenetic modulator that methylates lysine residue 4 on the tail of histone H3 (H3K4). Methylation of H3K4 leads to increased genome accessibility, recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and activation of gene expression (PMID: 25998713). MLL1 is crucial for embryogenesis and normal hematopoiesis by stimulating expression of several important developmental genes including the homeobox (Hox) genes (PMID: 24213472). Chromosomal translocations involving MLL1 that result in gain-of-function fusion proteins have been identified in pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and are overrepresented in therapy-related AML. Though MLL1 has a diverse group of fusion partners in leukemia, the most common MLL1 recombination partners include AF4, AF9, and ENL, which are proteins that interact with transcriptional elongation machinery (PMID: 28701730). MLL1 fusion proteins disrupt the normal activity of hematopoietic stem cells and the normal chromatin state, leading to activation of oncogenic signaling pathways (PMID: 16862118). In addition, loss-of-function mutations in MLL1 have been identified in solid tumors including bladder, stomach and endometrial cancers (PMID: 21822268, 23636398). DOT1L inhibitors, which are currently being tested in clinical trials, have been shown to have activity against MLL1-rearranged leukemias (PMID: 21741597, 21741596).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4297,"hugoSymbol":"KMT2A","name":"lysine methyltransferase 2A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000534358","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001197104.1","geneAliases":["MLL-AF9","MLL1","TRX1","HTRX1","TET1-MLL","ALL-1","MLL/GAS7","MLL","MLL1A","CXXC7","HRX","WDSTS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"21822268","title":"Frequent mutations of chromatin remodeling genes in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2011 Aug 7","volume":"43","issue":"9","pages":"875-8","authors":"Gui Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.907","link":null,"reference":"Gui Y et al.
