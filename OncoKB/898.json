High expression of Cyclin E1 is restricted to cells undergoing the G1/S transition due to transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CCNE1/Cyclin E1 (PMID: 1388288, 15838514, 22186781, 24605326). The Cyclin E1-CDK2 complex phosphorylates p27(Kip1) and p21 which signal for the degradation of Cyclin D and promotes the expression of Cyclin A, leading to progression through S phase (PMID: 8978686, 9192873). Cyclin E1-CDK2 phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma protein (RB) thus releasing the RB-mediated sequestration of the transcription factor E2F and allowing for activation of E2F-regulated cell cycle genes (PMID: 1388095, 1828392, 7623816). Degradation of Cyclin E1 is also highly regulated; Cyclin E1-CDK2 is degraded by SCF-Fbw7 (an E3 ligase that is commonly mutated in cancer). Insufficient degradation of Cyclin E1 by SCF-Fbw7 can lead to genomic instability and aberrant cell proliferation (PMID: 10611969, 11533444, 14536078, 11565033). Increased Cyclin E expression in cell lines leads to quicker passage through the G1/S phase, but deletion of Cyclin E or CDK2 in mice does not result in a G1/S defect (PMID: 8384376, 12941272, 12970191). Cyclin E knockout mice have a defect in cell cycle entry after quiescence (PMID: 12941272, 12970191). Cyclin E-CDK2 phosphorylates p220 (NPAT) to activate histone transcription (PMID: 10995387), p300/CBP (PMID: 10783242) and Smad3 (PMID: 21150326). Cyclin E also phosphorylates centrosomal proteins (PMID: 15514162), has a role in loading MCM to replication origins (PMID: 10806104) and regulates apoptosis via phosphorylation of FOXO1 (PMID: 12913110). Overexpression of Cyclin E1 has been implicated in many cancers and can be indicative of poor prognosis (PMID: 22186781).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":898,"hugoSymbol":"CCNE1","name":"cyclin E1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262643","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001238.2","geneAliases":["pCCNE1","CCNE"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15514162","title":"A centrosomal localization signal in cyclin E required for Cdk2-independent S phase entry.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2004 Oct 29","volume":"306","issue":"5697","pages":"885-8","authors":"Matsumoto Y et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Matsumoto Y et al.
