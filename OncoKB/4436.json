MSH2 forms heterodimers with other MutS proteins, MSH6 and MSH3, to form the MutS-alpha and MutS-beta mismatch repair (MMR) complexes, respectively (PMID: 8252616, 7973733). Both complexes are involved in the recognition of a mismatched base pair, forming a DNA-MutS complex that signals other components of the MMR machinery to excise the aberrant nucleotide. MSH2 and other MMR genes are most notably implicated in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome (PMID: 428275, 1648437). Loss of function mutations or epigenetic silencing both in the germline and somatic context lead to an increased mutation rate that drives carcinogenesis as well as microsatellite instability (MSI). MSH2 mutations represent approximately 40% of all HNPCC cases (PMID: 11852992) and are associated with the MSI-high phenotype, along with mutations in MLH1 (PMID: 9823339, 9354436). Although most commonly seen in colon cancer, MSH2 mutations have also been reported in a wide range of other cancer types and syndromes, including endometrial and uterine cancers, and sebaceous gland tumors (PMID: 19078925,16826164). Tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects have been predictive of clinical benefit to certain immune checkpoint blockade therapies (PMID:26028255, 25409260). Recently, the FDA approved pembrolizumab (PD-1 blockade) for all mismatch repair deficient and microsatellite unstable (MSI-high) tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4436,"hugoSymbol":"MSH2","name":"mutS homolog 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000233146","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000251.2","geneAliases":["LCFS2","HNPCC","COCA1","HNPCC1","FCC1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"7973733","title":"Binding of mismatched microsatellite DNA sequences by the human MSH2 protein.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"1994 Nov 25","volume":"266","issue":"5189","pages":"1403-5","authors":"Fishel R et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Fishel R et al.
