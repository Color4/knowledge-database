It is expressed on several types of cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid cells, as well as non-lymphoid organs including lung, liver and kidney (PMID: 9162061). TNFRSF14 is a tumor suppressor and immunogenicity regulation factor and is capable of sending both stimulatory and inhibitory signals to T cells depending on the particular ligand it binds (PMID: 23023713, 20884631). Mutations in TNFRSF14 has been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PMID: 22343534 ) and follicular lymphoma (FL) (PMID: 20884631, 24435047, 24162788, 21941365). These mutations are associated with high-risk clinical features, and patients with a mutation in TNFRSF14 responded poorly to rituximab (PMID: 20884631). Recurrent copy number loss of the region containing TNFRSF14 was observed in 42% of the cases with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) (PMID:26650888). Finally, TNFRSF14 expression is deregulated in colorectal cancer (PMID: 25750286), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 25468715) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID:24249528).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8764,"hugoSymbol":"TNFRSF14","name":"tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 14","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000355716","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003820.2","geneAliases":["HVEM","CD270","TR2","HVEA","ATAR","LIGHTR"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20884631","title":"Acquired TNFRSF14 mutations in follicular lymphoma are associated with worse prognosis.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2010 Nov 15","volume":"70","issue":"22","pages":"9166-74","authors":"Cheung KJ et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2460","link":null,"reference":"Cheung KJ et al.
