[{"evidenceId":18141,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RECQL4 appears to function both in single-stranded DNA annealing and double-stranded DNA unwinding and is involved in DNA replication and various types of DNA repair, including double-strand break repair, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair and single strand repair (PMID: 20065033, 20222902, 17320201, 18693251, 16949575, 22508716, 19567405). RECQL4 functions a tumor suppressor. Inheritance of two compromised alleles leads to Rothmund-Thomsom Syndrome (RTS), Baller-Gerold Syndrome (BGS), or RAPADILINO syndrome, each a rare syndrome with many overlapping phenotypic features. It has been suggested that the different syndromes are a result of mutations with different effects on the protein product, with certain domains involved in specific pathways (PMID: 20301383, 20113479, 17364146). RTS and RAPADILINO have a cancer predisposition, particularly osteosarcoma. RECQL4 somatic mutations, reported in tumors of numerous tissue types, are found across the gene without any specific hotspot. There is currently no therapy targeted at RECQL4 mutations.Missense mutations make up approximately 69% of all point mutations in RECQL4 in reported tumor samples. These mutations are scattered throughout the gene, include the Sld2 (DNA replicative factor) domain and the conserved RecQ-family helicase domain (PMID: 23238538, 23899764, 20668451, 24332040). Mutations in the Sld2 domain have the potential to affect the initiation of DNA replication (PMID: 25336622). Mutations within the helicase domain may affect the ability of RECQL4 to carry out strand annealing/unwinding functions (PMID: 25336622).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9401,"hugoSymbol":"RECQL4","name":"RecQ like helicase 4","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000428558","curatedRefSeq":"ENST00000428558","geneAliases":["RECQ4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17320201","title":"Possible involvement of RecQL4 in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks in Xenopus egg extracts.","journal":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","pubDate":"2007 Apr","volume":"1773","issue":"4","pages":"556-64","authors":"Kumata Y et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Kumata Y et al.
