It's ligands PD-L1/2 are important mediators of immune check point by preventing T-cell activation contributing to self-tolerance (PMID: 11209085, 11224527, 10485649). PD-L1 binding to PD1 leads to programmed cell death in antigen specific T-Cells and reduced apoptosis in regulatory T-cells which results in an overall decrease in immune response (PMID: 11857337, 16382236, 20208540). Several cancer entities highly express PD-L1 leading to immune evasion (PMID: 17195077, 12218188, 14871849, 15837746, 26359984). In the past years several drugs with inhibitory effects on PD1 have been developed and introduced into the clinic due to their therapeutic efficacy (PMID: 22658127, 26406148, 26412456, 26027431, 25891173, 25482239, 23724846).
