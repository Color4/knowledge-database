[{"evidenceId":17883,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"FOXP1 is a DNA binding protein that is a member of the P subfamily of forkhead box transcription factors and primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor (PMID: 10702024, 23792361, 23792361). FOXP1 regulates cell-type specific gene expression programs by binding to regulatory units and recruiting histone deacetylases and other cofactors (PMID: 22124370, 20185820). FOXP1 is required for thymocyte development, the generation of na√Øve T cells, and the development of lung and esophageal tissue (PMID: 19965654, 17428829). FOXP1 loss has been observed in a range of cancer types, including tumors of the kidney, liver, breast, and endometrium (PMID: 23792361, 16258506, 21210727, 15161711, 21901488, 22904134, 11751404). FOXP1 has also been found to be overexpressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, demonstrating that the impact of FOXP1 alterations is context specific (PMID: 19706818, 15709173, 22422806). FOXP1 is part of a translocation observed in the MALT subtype of lymphomas (PMID: 15703784, 20950788, 24214399, 18487996).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-20","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":27086,"hugoSymbol":"FOXP1","name":"forkhead box P1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000318789","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001244814.1","geneAliases":["HSPC215","12CC4","hFKH1B","QRF1","MFH"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15161711","title":"Expression of the forkhead transcription factor FOXP1 is associated with estrogen receptor alpha and improved survival in primary human breast carcinomas.","journal":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","pubDate":"2004 May 15","volume":"10","issue":"10","pages":"3521-7","authors":"Fox SB et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Fox SB et al.
