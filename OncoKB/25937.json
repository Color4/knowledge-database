TAZ, which shares homology and function with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), is able to translocate to the nucleus and interact with TEAD1-4 to activate a transcriptional program that promotes cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PMID: 11118213, 18227151, 19324877). The Hippo signaling pathway negatively regulates TAZ function via LATS1/2 phosphorylation, which prevents TAZ nuclear translocation (PMID: 18227151). WWTR1/TAZ is considered a novel oncogene in breast and lung cancer (PMID: 18413727, 21258416). WWTR1 is amplified in several tumors, such as lung, ovarian and head and neck cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016). Cancers with defective Hippo signaling pathway and subsequent TAZ activation are good candidates for novel small-molecule Hippo modulator drugs (PMID: 27262779, 24336504).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":25937,"hugoSymbol":"WWTR1","name":"WW domain containing transcription regulator 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000360632","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001168280.1","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18227151","title":"TAZ promotes cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition and is inhibited by the hippo pathway.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"2008 Apr","volume":"28","issue":"7","pages":"2426-36","authors":"Lei QY et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1128/MCB.01874-07","link":null,"reference":"Lei QY et al.
