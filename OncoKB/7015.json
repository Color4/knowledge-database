TERT expression is low or absent in somatic cells; however, telomerase activity is upregulated in a vast majority of tumors and likely contributes to cancer cell immortality (PMID: 24657534, 9282118). Sequencing of the TERT promoter identified activating mutations in a number of cancer types including melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, medulloblastoma and glioma (PMID: 23348506, 23530248). Tumors with highly recurrent TERT promoter mutations tend to originate from tissues with lower rates of self-renewal (PMID: 23530248). TERT promoter mutations, C228T and C250T, account for the majority of the somatic TERT promoter alterations and occur 124 and 146 base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon of TERT, respectively. Both promoter mutations create binding motifs for erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS)/ T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factors and enhance telomerase activity (PMID: 23348503, 23348506, 26194807). In addition to promoter mutations, TERT, located on chromosome 5p, is amplified across many cancer types (PMID: 20164920).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-06","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7015,"hugoSymbol":"TERT","name":"telomerase reverse transcriptase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000310581","curatedRefSeq":"NM_198253.2","geneAliases":["TP2","TRT","CMM9","PFBMFT1","TCS1","DKCA2","EST2","hEST2","hTRT","DKCB4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23348503","title":"TERT promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2013 Feb 22","volume":"339","issue":"6122","pages":"959-61","authors":"Horn S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1126/science.1230062","link":null,"reference":"Horn S et al.
