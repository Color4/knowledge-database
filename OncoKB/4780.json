Under normal cellular conditions, the interaction of NRF2 with KEAP1 retains the protein in the cytoplasm and promotes its proteasomal degradation via ubiquitination (PMID: 9887101). Upon sensing stress signals, KEAP1 undergoes a conformational change, preventing it from interacting with NRF2 and allowing NRF2 to translocate to the nucleus and drive the expression of specific genes (PMID:12359864). NRF2 can have a protective role in cancer formation from certain chemical carcinogens (PMID: 11248092). However, chronic activation of NRF2 can also support the development of chemo- and radio-resistance (PMID: 24142871). Tumor-associated NRF2 activation can result from inactivation of KEAP1 through mutation, loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing (PMID: 19321346). NRF2 activation can also arise directly from mutations in NFE2L2 in the KEAP1-binding domains (PMID: 18757741, 19967722).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4780,"hugoSymbol":"NFE2L2","name":"nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000397062","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006164.4","geneAliases":["NRF2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18757741","title":"Cancer related mutations in NRF2 impair its recognition by Keap1-Cul3 E3 ligase and promote malignancy.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2008 Sep 9","volume":"105","issue":"36","pages":"13568-73","authors":"Shibata T et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.0806268105","link":null,"reference":"Shibata T et al.
