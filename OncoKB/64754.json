[{"evidenceId":18293,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The SMYD3 gene encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase. SMYD3 specifically di- and trimethylates lysine-4 of histone 4 (H3K4me2/3), as well as the lysine-5 residue of the same histone. SMYD3-induced methylation generates transcription activating marks that induce gene expression. SMYD3 itself is part of the RNA polymerase complex, present on genes being actively transcribed (PMID: 15235609, 22419068). SMYD3 activity induces cell proliferation, migration and carcinogenesis in various in vitro and in vivo cancer systems via transcriptional activation of different target genes (PMID: 15235609, 25980436, 24174655, 22194464). SMYD3 is altered by amplification in a subset of breast cancers and other tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":64754,"hugoSymbol":"SMYD3","name":"SET and MYND domain containing 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000388985","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001167740.1","geneAliases":["KMT3E","bA74P14.1","ZNFN3A1","ZMYND1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22419068","title":"Smyd3 regulates cancer cell phenotypes and catalyzes histone H4 lysine 5 methylation.","journal":"Epigenetics","pubDate":"2012 Apr","volume":"7","issue":"4","pages":"340-3","authors":"Van Aller GS et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.4161/epi.19506","link":null,"reference":"Van Aller GS et al.
