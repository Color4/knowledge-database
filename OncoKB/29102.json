Drosha, forming a complex with DGCR8, cleaves the doubled-stranded stem-loop structured pri-miRNA into pre-miRNA, which is subsequently exported to the cytosol where it can be further processed, ultimately leading to specific mRNA silencing (PMID: 14508493, 19239886, 23654304). DROSHA has been reported to be both up- and downregulated in several cancers, suggesting tissue-specific mechanisms in tumorigenesis (PMID: 20832293, 21559780, 20210522). DROSHA is altered by point mutations or amplifications in a small proportion of tumors, such as squamous-cell, neuroendocrine pancreatic, breast and lung cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016) (PMID: 26156018).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":29102,"hugoSymbol":"DROSHA","name":"drosha ribonuclease III","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000344624","curatedRefSeq":"NM_013235.4","geneAliases":["RNASEN","RANSE3L","ETOHI2","HSA242976","RNASE3L","RN3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26156018","title":"High copy number variation of cancer-related microRNA genes and frequent amplification of DICER1 and DROSHA in lung cancer.","journal":"Oncotarget","pubDate":"2015 Sep 15","volume":"6","issue":"27","pages":"23399-416","authors":"Czubak K et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Czubak K et al.
