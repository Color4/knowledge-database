TNFAIP3 has ubiquitin ligase and de-ubiquitination activities that suppress the NF-κB pathway (PMID: 15258597). Its activity is important in regulating B-cell survival and apoptosis, inflammatory response, and dentric cell function in regulating T-cells (PMID: 20705491, 18311150, 25043000). Polymorphisms in TNFAIP3 are associated with many autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (PMID:19165919, 25684197, 24097067,17982455). Germline loss of function mutations are associated with autoimmune disease (PMID: 26642243). Mutations are found in B-cell lymphomas, T-cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia, and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PMID: 19412163, 21115979, 21625233, 26199174).
