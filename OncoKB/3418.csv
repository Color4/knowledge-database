8318,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"The IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2) protein is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH2 utilizes NADP(+) as an electron acceptor and it is expressed in the mitochondria, where it plays a role in cell metabolism and energy production via TCA cycle. Cancer-associated mutations in the catalytic site of IDH2 confer a gain-of-function of neomorphic enzymatic activity allowing the mutant enzyme to convert α-KG to the “oncometabolite” D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (PMID: 20171147). 2-HG promotes tumor development by inhibiting a variety of enzymes that require α-KG as a substrate, including enzymes involved in DNA demethylation, histone demethylation, adaptation to hypoxia and collagen maturation (PMID: 23630074). IDH2 mutations have been identified in hematologic malignancies, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as in solid tumors such as gliomas and cholangiocarcinomas.",,2017-08-02,,3418,IDH2,"isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 2, mitochondrial",True,ENST00000330062,NM_002168.2,IDHM,IDP,D2HGA2,mNADP-IDH,IDPM,IDH,ICD-M,False,23630074,"What a difference a hydroxyl makes: mutant IDH, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and cancer.",Genes &amp; development,2018-04-15T20:13:00,27,8,836-52,Losman JA et al,doi: 10.1101/gad.217406.113,,0001-04-15,,20171147,The common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations is a neomorphic enzyme activity converting alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate.,Cancer cell,2018-03-16T20:10:00,17,3,225-34,Ward PS et al,doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.01.020,,0001-03-16,
