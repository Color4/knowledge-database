[{"evidenceId":10884,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is comprised of a regulatory subunit (p85α) as well as a catalytic subunit (p110α) and it is the catalytic subunit that is encoded by the PIK3CA gene. PIK3CA is among the most commonly mutated genes in cancer and aberrant activation of PI3K is a transforming event (PMID: 17376864). Multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), RET, MET, and VEGFR, among others, convert extracellular cues into intracellular signals and recruit PI3K to the plasma membrane via scaffold proteins such as IRS1 or by activating RAS. Upon stimulation, PI3K-110α converts its lipid substrate PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol - 4,5 - bisphosphate) to PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol - 3,4,5 - bisphosphate), which activates several signaling cascades, including the well-characterized AKT-mTOR pathway. Once activated, AKT-mTOR downstream signaling promotes cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility (PMID: 16341083). Adding to this complexity, exposure to some PI3K/mTOR pathway targeted drugs relieves cancer cells of self-regulatory properties inherent in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway thereby promoting tumor resistance to these agents (PMID: 22576208).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5290,"hugoSymbol":"PIK3CA","name":"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263967","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006218.2","geneAliases":["MCAP","p110-alpha","PI3K","CLOVE","MCM","PI3K-alpha","CWS5","MCMTC"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16341083","title":"Oncogenic PI3K deregulates transcription and translation.","journal":"Nature reviews.
