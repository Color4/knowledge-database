4704,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"The MYC gene encodes a transcription factor that heterodimerizes with the protein MAX to control the transcription of thousands of genes. MYC promotes tumorigenesis by inducing proliferation, inhibiting exit from the cell cycle, stimulating vascularization and enhancing genomic instability (PMID: 22464321,10378696,16934487,19029958). MYC becomes activated in cancers through a variety of mechanisms, including chromosomal translocations (typically associated with blood cancers, and associated with constitutive over-expression), as well as genomic amplification and overexpression (PMID: 22464321). Mutations in the MYC gene occur, but are less frequent than amplification and translocation. Mutations of known function reside near residue T58, which is a phosphorylation site on MYC critical for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the MYC protein (PMID: 10706881). The MYC gene family consists of three related genes: (1) c-MYC (herein referred to as MYC, encoded by the gene MYC), (2) N-MYC (encoded by the gene MYCN) and (3) L-MYC (encoded by the gene MYCL1) (PMID: 16934487). The MYC gene is located on at the chromosomal locus 8q24, and contains several distinct structural domains, including) an N-terminus transcriptional activation domain, a central portion and a C-terminus DNA-binding domain containing a basis helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif. Within these domains are five ""Myc-boxes,"" regions which are highly conserved in MYC family proteins across multiple species (PMID: 19029958).",,2017-04-03,,4609,MYC,v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog,True,ENST00000377970,NM_002467.4,c-Myc,MYCC,MRTL,bHLHe39,False,19029958,0026-01-01,Nature reviews.
