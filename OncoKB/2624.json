[{"evidenceId":19585,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"GATA2 encodes the GATA binding protein 2 transcription factor. GATA2 is involved in hematopoiesis and differentiation, including stem cell maintenance and cell specification (PMID:8078582, 12433372, 25578878, 20887958). It is also involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (PMID:23892628). Inherited GATA2 mutations are associated with familial myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID:21892162). Mutations are also associated with a heritable lymphedema disorder, Emberger syndrome, with a disposition to AML (PMID:21892158). It is also found in patients with MonoMAC syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder predisposed to select infectious agents (PMID:21670465). Somatic GATA2 mutations are found in leukemias and often co-occur with CEBPA mutations (PMID:23634996,22649106, 23521373,18250304). Inversion 3 leukemias involve dysregulation of GATA2 and EV1 by translocation of a GATA2 enhancer that regulates gene expression (PMID:24703711). In lung cancer, GATA2 was shown to regulate Ras signaling (PMID:22541434). In prostate cancer and other tumors, GATA2 can promote resistance and metastasis (PMID:25670080, 24448395, 25707769).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2624,"hugoSymbol":"GATA2","name":"GATA binding protein 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000341105","curatedRefSeq":"NM_032638.4","geneAliases":["DCML","MONOMAC","NFE1B","IMD21"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23634996","title":"Genomic and epigenomic landscapes of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia.","journal":"The New England journal of medicine","pubDate":"2013 May 30","volume":"368","issue":"22","pages":"2059-74","authors":"Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1301689","link":null,"reference":"Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. et al.
