[{"evidenceId":5131,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The FLT3 gene encodes a type 3 transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (PMID: 12032772). The receptor is activated following dimerization and autophosphorylation upon binding by its ligand, FLT3L. FLT3 activation results in increased signaling through several pathways including the MAP-kinase, PI3-kinase/AKT and STAT3/5 pathways, which have roles in hematopoietic proliferation, differentiation and survival (PMID: 23631653, 12951584). Wildtype FLT3 is important for the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, however, loss of FLT3 in murine models is not sufficient to cause leukemogenesis (PMID: 23631653). Therefore, additional oncogenic alterations cooperate with over-activation of FLT3 to cause malignancy. FLT3 is commonly expressed on immature myeloid and lymphoid cells, and therefore FLT3 alterations most typically give rise to leukemias (PMID: 12951584). The most common leukemic FLT3 alterations include FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) (about 25% of adult acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs)) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (about 7% of adult AMLs) (PMID: 24319184). FLT3 small molecule kinase inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials (PMID: 24682858).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-08","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2322,"hugoSymbol":"FLT3","name":"fms related tyrosine kinase 3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000241453","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004119.2","geneAliases":["STK1","FLK-2","CD135","FLK2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23631653","title":"FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia: clinical implications and limitations.","journal":"Leukemia &amp; lymphoma","pubDate":"2014 Feb","volume":"55","issue":"2","pages":"243-55","authors":"Kayser S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.800198","link":null,"reference":"Kayser S et al.
