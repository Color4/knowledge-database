In adult and malignant tissues, FGF4 expression is tightly regulated. FGF4 expression is restricted to undifferentiated human embryonal carcinomas (ECs). During induced differentiation, FGF4 expression is repressed (PMID: 9715278). FGF4 gene amplification has been observed in numerous human carcinomas such as breast carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and the oesophagus, epithelial ovarian tumors and bladder cancers (PMID: 10368635, 9816285, 9380415, 1532244, 7511290, 1361954). FGF4 plays a key role in the growth or maturation states of germ cell tumors which is supported by the finding FGF4 expression occurs in a subset of clinical germ cell tumors, especially in those presenting with advanced state (PMID: 1706218).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2249,"hugoSymbol":"FGF4","name":"fibroblast growth factor 4","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000168712","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002007.2","geneAliases":["HBGF-4","HST-1","K-FGF","HST","HSTF1","KFGF"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"7511290","title":"[Demonstration of gene amplification in urinary bladder cancer by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)].","journal":"Verhandlungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Pathologie","pubDate":"1993","volume":"77","issue":"","pages":"247-51","authors":"Sauter G et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sauter G et al.
