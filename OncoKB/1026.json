[{"evidenceId":7724,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CDKN1A gene encodes the p21 (WAF1) protein, which is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. p21 inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinases CDC2 and CDK2, leading to G1 phase cell cycle arrest. p21 expression is upregulated by DNA damage through a p53-dependent mechanism (PMID: 8242752). Moreover, activation of the PI3K/AKT mitogenic signaling pathway results in phosphorylation and localization of p21 to the cytoplasm where it can no longer access its CDK targets, leading to enhanced cell proliferation. p21 may play a role in repair of DNA damage through interactions with DNA polymerase accessory factors. Loss of p21 can lead to chromosomal aneuploidy, implying a role in mitotic regulation. p21 expression is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and protein levels: tumor suppressors and oncoproteins modulate transcription of CDKN1A while post-translational p21 modification regulates proteasomal degradation and subcellular localization (PMID: 9296497, 10319992). The majority of p21 alterations in cancer are truncating, concurrent with its role as a tumor suppressor, and p21 knockout mouse models display an increased incidence of a variety of cancers as compared to mice with intact p21 expression (PMID: 7664346, 12810620). p21 also exhibits anti-apoptotic activity in certain contexts, suggesting that it also possesses an oncogenic role. Inhibitors targeting the checkpoint kinase Chk1 in combination with chemotherapy have been found to have anti-tumor activity in bladder cancer (PMID: 25349305).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1026,"hugoSymbol":"CDKN1A","name":"cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000244741","curatedRefSeq":"NM_078467.2","geneAliases":["CIP1","p21CIP1","CDKN1","WAF1","CAP20","P21","MDA-6","SDI1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"7664346","title":"Mice lacking p21CIP1/WAF1 undergo normal development, but are defective in G1 checkpoint control.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"1995 Aug 25","volume":"82","issue":"4","pages":"675-84","authors":"Deng C et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Deng C et al.
