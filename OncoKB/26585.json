It is a secreted protein that binds to BMP ligands to prevent BMP receptor activation (PMID:25378054). It regulates kidney formation, skeletal development, and the osteochondroreticular stem cell, responsible for making osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and reticular marrow stromal cells (PMID:17522159, 21303853, 25594183, 15201225). It is expressed in various tumor cells and in glioma cells acts to maintain stem cell potential (PMID:24788093, 23826422, 17003113). A duplication including the upstream region of the GREM1 gene is associated with Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome and an increased risk of developing colon cancer (PMID:22561515). This duplication causes ectopic expression of GREM1 in the colonic epithelium and acquisition of stem cell capacity in more mature progenitor cells (PMID:25419707).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":26585,"hugoSymbol":"GREM1","name":"gremlin 1, DAN family BMP antagonist","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000300177","curatedRefSeq":"NM_013372.6","geneAliases":["PIG2","CRCS4","DAND2","GREMLIN","HMPS","CKTSF1B1","IHG-2","DUP15q","C15DUPq","HMPS1","CRAC1","MPSH","DRM"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17522159","title":"Reduction of BMP4 activity by gremlin 1 enables ureteric bud outgrowth and GDNF/WNT11 feedback signalling during kidney branching morphogenesis.","journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","pubDate":"2007 Jul","volume":"134","issue":"13","pages":"2397-405","authors":"Michos O et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Michos O et al.
