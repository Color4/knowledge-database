[{"evidenceId":19681,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MST1 (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) gene encodes a kinase and key component of the Hippo signaling pathway. The Hippo signaling cascade is a critical regulator for controlling cell growth, differentiation and organ size control (PMID: 22683405, 22898666). MST1 is proteolyticaly activated by caspases during apoptosis; activation is mediated by apoptotic stimuli and other stress signals. Full activation of MST1 kinase requires autophosphorylation at Thr-183 and caspase-mediated cleavage. Once activated, MST1 phosphorylates Lats1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2), which then phosphorylates and inhibits two transcriptional coactivators in the Hippo pathway, YAP and TAZ (PMID:17889654). Phosphorylated YAP and TAZ remain in the cytoplasm and cannot induce the expression of genes that promote cell growth and proliferation (PMID: 17889654). Hence, MST1 negatively regulates YAP and TAZ and acts as a tumor suppressor. Reduced expression of MST1 has been observed in gastric cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer and soft tissue sarcoma (PMID: 21940329, 17538946, 18381433).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4485,"hugoSymbol":"MST1","name":"macrophage stimulating 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000449682","curatedRefSeq":"NM_020998.3","geneAliases":["NF15S2","HGFL","D3F15S2","MSP","DNF15S2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17538946","title":"Frequent hypermethylation of MST1 and MST2 in soft tissue sarcoma.","journal":"Molecular carcinogenesis","pubDate":"2007 Oct","volume":"46","issue":"10","pages":"865-71","authors":"Seidel C et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Seidel C et al.
