Methylation of H3K4 leads to increased genome accessibility, recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and activation of gene expression (PMID: 25998713). MLL3 specifically binds histones at enhancer regions, leading to increased expression of a wide range of target genes and regulation of enhancer RNA synthesis (PMID: 24081332, 23166019, 28483418, 27926873). MLL3 is ubiquitously expressed and its function is crucial for normal embryonal development and cell proliferation (PMID: 11718452, 17021013). Genetic deletion of the region containing KMT2C is the most common chromosomal abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 25794446, 11891048, 22234698, 25030029), and MLL3 is mutated in various types of cancer (PMID: 25537518, 25303977, 25151357, 28801450).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":58508,"hugoSymbol":"KMT2C","name":"lysine methyltransferase 2C","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262189","curatedRefSeq":"NM_170606.2","geneAliases":["MLL3","HALR"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25030029","title":"Mutation and expression analysis in medulloblastoma yields prognostic variants and a putative mechanism of disease for i17q tumors.","journal":"Acta neuropathologica communications","pubDate":"2014 Jul 17","volume":"2","issue":"","pages":"74","authors":"Bien-Willner GA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1186/s40478-014-0074-1","link":null,"reference":"Bien-Willner GA et al.
