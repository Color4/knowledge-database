[{"evidenceId":10214,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"EED (Embryonic Ectoderm Development) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) which is responsible for transcriptional repression by catalyzing di- and tri-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) (PMID: 16630818). The EED-EZH2 interaction is necessary for the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 (PMID: 23974116), which is important in regulating development and expression of cell identity genes, including the HOX cluster of genes (PMID: 16625203). EED interacts with the PRC1 complex to mediate histone H2A ubiquitination (PMID: 24457600), and germline mutations have been identified with an over-growth syndrome (PMID: 25787343). EED is mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 25240281, 22237106, 23486531). Loss of PRC2 function can cooperate with Ras pathway signaling in cellular transformation and may sensitize tumor cells to bromodomain inhibitors (PMID: 25119042).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8726,"hugoSymbol":"EED","name":"embryonic ectoderm development","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263360","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003797.3","geneAliases":["WAIT1","HEED"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25119042","title":"PRC2 loss amplifies Ras-driven transcription and confers sensitivity to BRD4-based therapies.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2014 Oct 9","volume":"514","issue":"7521","pages":"247-51","authors":"De Raedt T et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature13561","link":null,"reference":"De Raedt T et al.
