[{"evidenceId":18369,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"REL encodes a transcription factor in the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors regulating immune function (PMID:22405852). It is important for the development of regulatory T-cells, B-cell proliferation and survival, and cytokine production (PMID:19995950,10049356,12646638, 12426000). While normally expressed mainly in lymphocytes, it has also been found expressed in various solid cancer types in an oncogenic role (PMID:18037997, 21933882). Polymorphisms in REL are associated with autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders (PMID:19503088, 20953190, 21425313). REL is most frequently altered by amplifications seen in both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas (PMID: 11433522, 12511414, 11830502). It can also be over expressed in lymphomas through translocation with the immunglobulin loci (PMID:17079453). Mutations that alter REL transactivation activity are rare but have been seen in lymphomas (PMID:17072339,1650444, 11921291). REL promotes lymphoma proliferation and cell survival and inhibitors are in development for lymphoma therapy (PMID:17567982, 26744524).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-23","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5966,"hugoSymbol":"REL","name":"REL proto-oncogene, NF-kB subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000295025","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002908.2","geneAliases":["C-Rel"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"1650444","title":"Alterations at the rel locus in human lymphoma.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"1991 Jul","volume":"6","issue":"7","pages":"1235-41","authors":"Lu D et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lu D et al.
