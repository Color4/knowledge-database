PAX5 plays a key role in the commitment of bone marrow multipotent progenitors to the B-lymphoid lineage by favoring VDJ gene rearrangement and activating the expression of B-cellâ€“specific genes (PMID: 9442394) while simultaneously repressing genes involved in other hematopoietic differentiation programs (PMID: 12479824). PAX5 mutations, translocations, and deletions are found in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) (PMID: 17344859, 8943844).
