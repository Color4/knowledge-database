This complex plays a role in altering chromatin structure, a process that is necessary for various cellular functions, including transcription, DNA synthesis and DNA repair (reviewed in PMID: 25387058). Secondary to ARID1A, SMARCA4 is the most frequently mutated gene among the SWI/SNF subunits and is significantly altered in malignant rhabdoid tumors, lymphoma, medulloblastoma, lung and ovarian cancer (PMID: 23644491, 25060813, 23143597). Mutations in the SMARCA4 gene result in loss of function, suggesting its tumor suppressor properties. Germline SMARCA4 mutations predispose to pediatric atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) (PMID: 20137775, 25060813) and small cell carcinoma of the ovaries, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) (PMID: 24658002, 24658004). Almost all SCCOHT cases have mutations in the SMARCA4 gene. In the majority of cases this is the only mutation present, and thus thought to be a driver mutation for this disease (PMID: 24658002, 24658004, 24658001).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6597,"hugoSymbol":"SMARCA4","name":"SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000344626","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003072.3","geneAliases":["SNF2LB","SNF2","SNF2L4","BAF190","BRG1","BAF190A","MRD16","RTPS2","SWI2","hSNF2b","CSS4"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25387058","title":"SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and human malignancies.","journal":"Annual review of pathology","pubDate":"2015","volume":"10","issue":"","pages":"145-71","authors":"Masliah-Planchon J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1146/annurev-pathol-012414-040445","link":null,"reference":"Masliah-Planchon J et al.
