[{"evidenceId":19146,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The IGF1R gene encodes the Type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (PMID: 19029956), a tyrosine kinase which activates downstream pathways involved in growth and cell survival. IGF1R binds several ligands, including high affinity ligands (insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1)) and low-affinity ligands (insulin, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2)) (PMID: 12360255, 19029956, 22337149). Binding to ligands activates two oncogenic pathways, the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway and the RAS-MAPK pathway (PMID: 25984556). Missense mutations of IGF1R are observed across the entire gene body, and several of these mutations have been linked to changes in the basal activity of IGF1R (PMID: 22778948). IGF1R is over-expressed in several cancers, and its over-expression in cell lines can induce transformation (PMID: 9196021). IGF1R is frequently mutated/amplified across a variety of cancer types (frequency ~8%) (cBioPortal, Nov 2015, PMID: 25984556). Binding of ligand to IGF1R has been reported to mediate both resistance and sensitivity to both targeted and cytotoxic therapy across a number of cancer types (PMID: 25984556, 22337149). Various therapeutics have been developed to target IGF1R, either as monoclonal antibodies against IGF1R or IGF1R ligands, or as inhibitors of the kinase activity of IGF1R, but these therapeutics have shown limited success in large clinical trials (PMID: 23601239, 24338270 ).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-31","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3480,"hugoSymbol":"IGF1R","name":"insulin like growth factor 1 receptor","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000268035","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000875.3","geneAliases":["IGFIR","IGFR","JTK13","CD221"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19029956","title":"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor signalling in neoplasia.","journal":"Nature reviews.
