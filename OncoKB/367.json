The AR protein acts as a steroid-hormone activated transcription factor, with a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a DNA-binding domain. In the absence of androgen, AR is predominantly maintained in an inactive conformation in the cytoplasm (PMID: 9175625, 12269826). Upon androgen binding, AR undergoes an activating conformational change that allows for its translocation into the nucleus, homodimerization and binding to DNA at sites with androgen response elements motifs (PMID: 9175625, 12000757, 11376111, 8360187). In concert with accessory coactivators and corepressors, AR serves to activate or repress the transcription of AR target genes (PMID: 11931767, 17679089). Germline loss-of-function mutations within AR cause genetic XY males and rodents to develop as external phenotypic females, also lacking internal sexual secondary organs (PMID: 4402348, 2341409, 2041777, 3186717, 2594783). AR signaling is very important in prostate cancers, particularly in tumors that become resistant to androgen deprivation therapies, termed castration resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). AR is frequently altered in CRPCs (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2015), resulting in continued activation despite a castrate level of androgen (Reviewed in 26566796).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":367,"hugoSymbol":"AR","name":"androgen receptor","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000374690","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000044.3","geneAliases":["NR3C4","DHTR","HYSP1","SBMA","SMAX1","AR8","KD","TFM","AIS","HUMARA"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"4402348","title":"Studies on the pathogenesis of the pseudohermaphroditism in the mouse with testicular feminization.","journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","pubDate":"1972 Jul","volume":"51","issue":"7","pages":"1647-58","authors":"Goldstein JL et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Goldstein JL et al.
