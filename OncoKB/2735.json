[{"evidenceId":9504,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"GLI1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an important role in normal neural development and function via regulation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway (PMID: 9634234,9584120). The GLI1 transcription factor binds DNA directly to activate Shh target genes in response to pathway activation and can function as both a transcription activator and transcription repressor depending on the signaling context (PMID: 10375510). In the absence of Shh ligand, GLI1 is cleaved by proteases to produce a truncated protein lacking C-terminal amino acids necessary for transcription activation (PMID: 9215627). Following Shh ligand exposure, GLI1 is no longer cleaved and can activate transcription of Shh target genes. GLI1 is an oncogene and is typically mutated or overexpressed in glioblastomas, where it can cause aberrant activation of the Shhâ€“Gli signaling pathway (PMID: 12044012).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2735,"hugoSymbol":"GLI1","name":"GLI family zinc finger 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000228682","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005269.2","geneAliases":["GLI"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9215627","title":"Proteolysis that is inhibited by hedgehog targets Cubitus interruptus protein to the nucleus and converts it to a repressor.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"1997 Jun 27","volume":"89","issue":"7","pages":"1043-53","authors":"Aza-Blanc P et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Aza-Blanc P et al.
