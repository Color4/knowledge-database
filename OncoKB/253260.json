[{"evidenceId":14755,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The RICTOR (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) gene encodes a core component of the mTOR complex-2 (mTOR2), which also includes mTOR, mLST8, DEPTOR, PRAS40, SIN1, and PROTOR1/2 (PMID: 20418915 ). RICTOR is an upstream kinase for several AGC kinase family members, including AKT/PKB, PKC (protein kinase C) and SGK1 (serum-glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase-1). In response to growth factors, mTOR2 phosphorylates and activates these kinases to regulate cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation and survival (PMID: 22350330, 15268862, 15718470, 18566586, 18925875, 17141160, 18566587). Included in the mTORC2 targets is AKT, a key component in the pro-oncogenic PI3-kinase signaling pathway that regulates various cellular functions including cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis (PMID: 25505994, 15718470). RICTOR also associates with factors independent of mTOR (PMID: 20832730, 18339839, 18426911), and some of the less well-characterized mTOR-independent functions of RICTOR include regulation of cell morphology, migration and protein degradation (PMID: 21670596). Overexpression of RICTOR is positively associated with tumor progression and poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 25371154), endometrial carcinoma (PMID: 24966915), pituitary adenoma (PMID: 23898069) and gastric cancer (PMID: 26159923). Upregulation of RICTOR is associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastasis, suggesting RICTOR as a potential biomarker for prognosis and stratification of patients with RCC (PMID:26500094). The RICTOR locus is amplified in melanoma (PMID: 26356562) and lung cancer (PMID: 26370156).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":253260,"hugoSymbol":"RICTOR","name":"RPTOR independent companion of MTOR complex 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000357387","curatedRefSeq":"NM_152756.3","geneAliases":["AVO3","PIA","hAVO3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15268862","title":"Rictor, a novel binding partner of mTOR, defines a rapamycin-insensitive and raptor-independent pathway that regulates the cytoskeleton.","journal":"Current biology : CB","pubDate":"2004 Jul 27","volume":"14","issue":"14","pages":"1296-302","authors":"Sarbassov DD et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sarbassov DD et al.
