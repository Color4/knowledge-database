AKT3, along with closely related AKT1 and AKT2, are members of the AGC kinase family. Effects of AKT activation include cell cycle progression and increased migration, differentiation and glucose homeostasis (PMID: 12094235). AKT3 activation occurs when its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) dislodges from the kinase domain (KD), localizes to the cell membrane, and several of its key residues become phosphorylated (PMID: 12094235). AKT3 is an oncogene and is amplified in many cancers, including glioblastoma (PMID: 19597332, 25737557). There are numerous drugs that target the PI3K/AKT pathway, including inhibitors of AKT itself, as well as inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR (PMID: 19629070).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-20","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10000,"hugoSymbol":"AKT3","name":"AKT serine/threonine kinase 3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263826","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005465.4","geneAliases":["RAC-gamma","PRKBG","RAC-PK-gamma","MPPH2","PKBG","PKB-GAMMA","STK-2","MPPH"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19629070","title":"Targeting PI3K signalling in cancer: opportunities, challenges and limitations.","journal":"Nature reviews.
