[{"evidenceId":17896,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CXCR4 gene encodes an alpha-chemokine receptor specific to a stromal-derived factor CXCL12, a molecule with potent chemotactic activity for lymphocytes. Through autocrine and paracrine interactions, the CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling axis promotes cancer cell proliferation, survival, motility and drug resistance (PMID: 20484021). Expression of CXCR4 in cancer cells has been linked to metastasis to tissues containing high levels of CXCL12, like the bone, lungs, liver and lymph nodes (PMID: 21866172, PMID: 20484021, PMID: 17891505, PMID: 11242036). The CXCR4-CXCL12 axis was also found to induce angiogenesis in several malignancies through hypoxia-induced CXCR4 expression and recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells to tumors (PMID: 15180966, PMID: 15882617, PMID: 21618540). Very few mutations in CXCR4 have been reported, but its elevated expression is a poor prognostic marker in many cancers, including breast, ovarian, melanoma and prostate cancers. A dominant germ line mutation in CXCR4 causes WHIM syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by neutropenia (PMID: 21178277). Further, a somatic mutation in CXCR4 was recently identified in Waldenström macroglobulinemia, an indolent B-cell malignancy (PMID: 24366360). Inhibitors of the CXCL4-CXCL12 axis are in several Phase I/II clinical trials for stem cell mobilization and HIV research; these inhibitors have not yet been evaluated in the context of cancer (PMID: 24141062).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7852,"hugoSymbol":"CXCR4","name":"C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000241393","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003467.2","geneAliases":["NPYRL","CD184","NPY3R","HM89","NPYY3R","LAP-3","HSY3RR","D2S201E","LCR1","WHIMS","LESTR","FB22","WHIM","NPYR"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15180966","title":"Role of high expression levels of CXCR4 in tumor growth, vascularization, and metastasis.","journal":"FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","pubDate":"2004 Aug","volume":"18","issue":"11","pages":"1240-2","authors":"Darash-Yahana M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Darash-Yahana M et al.
