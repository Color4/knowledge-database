PAK5, along with other members of the PAK family, is an effector of the small GTPases CDC42 and RAC (PMID: 12860998), and it plays a role in cell motility and survival (PMID: 18199048). PAK5 is mainly expressed in the brain, where it promotes neurite outgrowth by activating JNK signaling (PMID: 12032833, 11756552, 15322108). PAK5 regulates apoptosis by phosphorylating the proapoptotic protein BAD, thereby preventing its localization to the mitochondria and the subsequent activation of the apoptotic signaling cascade (PMID: 12897128). In addition, PAK5 induces microtubule stabilization by inhibiting the MARK2 kinase (PMID: 16014608). Somatic mutations and aberrant expression of PAK5 have been observed in various cancer types (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov. 2015). Increased expression of PAK5 has been found in progressing colorectal cancer (CRC), and PAK5 has been observed to regulate CRC cell adhesion and metastasis (PMID: 19415746, 20567954). Additionally, PAK5 copy number alterations have been observed in gastric cancer, uveal melanoma, osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 23106939, 16845324, 25052921, 26116538). Activating mutations have been reported in lung cancer (PMID: 23836671, 17344846).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":57144,"hugoSymbol":"PAK5","name":"p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 5","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000353224","curatedRefSeq":"NM_177990.2","geneAliases":["PAK7"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25052921","title":"p21-activated kinase 7 is an oncogene in human osteosarcoma.","journal":"Cell biology international","pubDate":"2014 Dec","volume":"38","issue":"12","pages":"1394-402","authors":"Han K et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1002/cbin.10351","link":null,"reference":"Han K et al.
