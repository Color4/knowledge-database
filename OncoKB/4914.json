NTRK1 consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular region harboring the tyrosine kinase domain. Oncogenic activation of NTRK1 leads to autophosphorylation and activation of the MAP-kinase, PI3-kinase and PLC-Î³ pathways, mediating cell proliferation, survival and differentiation (PMID: 10851172, 12652644). NTRK1 mutations and fusions are found in various cancers. Treatment strategies for NTRK1-altered cells include broad inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases as well as more specific inhibitors of the NTRK-family of kinases.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-23","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4914,"hugoSymbol":"NTRK1","name":"neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000524377","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002529.3","geneAliases":["TRK1","TRKA","Trk-A","TRK","p140-TrkA","MTC"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12652644","title":"RET and NTRK1 proto-oncogenes in human diseases.","journal":"Journal of cellular physiology","pubDate":"2003 May","volume":"195","issue":"2","pages":"168-86","authors":"Alberti L et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Alberti L et al.
