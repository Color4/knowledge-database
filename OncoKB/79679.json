[{"evidenceId":18341,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"VTCN1 encodes the V-set domain containing T cell activation inhibitor 1, also known as B7-H4 and plays critical roles in regulating T cell-mediated immune response through inhibiting T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and the development of cytotoxicity (PMID: 19641607, 12818166, 14568939). B7-H4 is highly expressed in various human tumors, including breast (PMID: 15756008, 15878339), ovarian (PMID: 19955922), lung (PMID: 16782226, 23874109), pancreatic (PMID: 25170273), gastric (PMID: 20872810, 21748517) and urothelial cell carcinoma (PMID: 25400757, 25364421). Soluble B7-H4 (sB7-H4) has been detected in blood samples from various cancer patients, including ovarian (PMID: 16452214, 17490732), gastric (PMID: 24947047), lung (PMID: 25636447), renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 18676826), bladder urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 25364421), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID:25963168) and high levels of sB7-H4 were a significant prognostic indicator. Moreover, the VTCN1 genetic variants rs10754339, rs10801935, and rs3738414 indicate they could be connected with the risk of breast cancer (PMID: 25385143).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":79679,"hugoSymbol":"VTCN1","name":"V-set domain containing T cell activation inhibitor 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000369458","curatedRefSeq":"NM_024626.3","geneAliases":["VCTN1","B7X","B7h.5","PRO1291","B7S1","B7-H4","B7H4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19641607","title":"Systematic analysis of immune infiltrates in high-grade serous ovarian cancer reveals CD20, FoxP3 and TIA-1 as positive prognostic factors.","journal":"PloS one","pubDate":"2009 Jul 29","volume":"4","issue":"7","pages":"e6412","authors":"Milne K et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006412","link":null,"reference":"Milne K et al.
