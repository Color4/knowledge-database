[{"evidenceId":13087,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The NFκBIα (NF-κB inhibitor α) gene encodes a protein that represses signaling of NF-κB, a family of transcription factors activated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. NFκBIα helps keep NFκB in an inactive state by supporting its interaction with inhibitory molecules in the cell cytoplasm. A range of external stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors or stress, can lead to phosphorylation of NFκBIα and subsequently the release and nuclear translocation of NFκB; this results in the transcriptional activation of hundreds of genes that regulate the immune response, protect against apoptosis and signaling pathways critical to the formation of ectodermal tissues. Lack of NFκB is often due to loss-of-function mutations (small insertions, deletions, or missense) in one allele of NFκBIα coupled with deletion or inactivation of the second allele (PMID: 9572494). Constitutive expression of NF-κB signaling results in overexpression of several target genes encoding anti-apoptotic proteins and growth-promoting proteins (PMID: 11313274). Deletion of NFκBIA has demonstrated an effect similar to EGFR amplification in glioblastomas (GBM) and is associated with relatively reduced survival (PMID: 21175304). Further, enrichment of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations in NFκBIA have been observed in Hodgkin’s lymphoma (PMID: 10023670, 19507254), colorectal cancer (PMID: 17354114), melanoma (PMID: 17492467), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 19797428), breast cancer (PMID: 16959974) and multiple myeloma (PMID: 16540234).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-06","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4792,"hugoSymbol":"NFKBIA","name":"NFKB inhibitor alpha","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000216797","curatedRefSeq":"NM_020529.2","geneAliases":["IKBA","NFKBI","MAD-3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16959974","title":"The consensus coding sequences of human breast and colorectal cancers.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2006 Oct 13","volume":"314","issue":"5797","pages":"268-74","authors":"Sjöblom T et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sjöblom T et al.
