[{"evidenceId":10573,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The AKT1 gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a critical downstream effector in the PI3K signaling pathway. AKT1, along with closely related AKT2 and AKT3, are members of the AGC kinase family. Effects of AKT activation include altered cellular metabolism, acceleration of cell cycle progression, increases in cell size, and evasion from cell death. AKT1 activation occurs when its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) dislodges from the kinase domain (KD), localizes to the cell membrane, and several of its key residues become phosphorylated, including S473 and T308 (PMID: 9843996, 7611497). AKT1 is frequently activated in cancers, typically through mutation or activation of P13K genes, or by inactivation of PTEN. Activating mutations in AKT1 that allow phosphoinositide-independent AKT1 activation (PMID: 17611497, 23134728, 20440266) and infrequent AKT1 gene amplification (PMID: 18767981) have been identified in human cancers.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-20","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":207,"hugoSymbol":"AKT1","name":"AKT serine/threonine kinase 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000349310","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001014431.1","geneAliases":["PRKBA","RAC","PKB","CWS6","AKT","RAC-ALPHA","PKB-ALPHA"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20440266","title":"Oncogenic E17K mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1 promotes v-Abl-mediated pre-B-cell transformation and survival of Pim-deficient cells.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2010 Jul 1","volume":"29","issue":"26","pages":"3845-53","authors":"Guo G et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.149","link":null,"reference":"Guo G et al.
