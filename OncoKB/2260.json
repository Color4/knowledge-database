[{"evidenceId":9804,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"FGFR1 encodes fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is important for mitogenesis and differentiation. FGFR1 is composed of three immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains, a transmembrane component and a cytosolic tyrosine kinase domain that acts via the MAPK pathway (PMID: 8622701). The protein rapidly dimerizes and ultimately internalizes to the nucleus after binding of fibroblast growth factor ligands, primarily FGF1 and FGF2. However, binding varies with tissue distribution and ligand availability (PMID: 16597617). FGFR1 is widely expressed in tissue, and is necessary for a variety of functions such as embryonic development, skeletogenesis, mitogenesis and differentiation. Congenital mutations are associated with physical malformations, mental retardation and neurologic deficits (PMID: 23812909). Amplifying or activating mutations in FGFR1 occur in varying frequency in multiple cancers including those of the lung, breast, prostate, head and neck and esophagus (PMID: 21160078, 20179196, 14614009, 16807070, 12147242). In metastatic renal cell carcinoma, FGF signaling has been hypothesized to mediate acquired treatment resistance with angiogenic escape from VEGF-directed therapies (PMID: 24387233). Currently, a number of small molecule inhibitors of the FGFR proteins are in use, with the major difference among them being their specificity to FGFR versus other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (PMID: PMID: 23696246, 24265351).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2260,"hugoSymbol":"FGFR1","name":"fibroblast growth factor receptor 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000425967","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001174067.1","geneAliases":["N-SAM","FLT2","ECCL","CEK","HBGFR","HRTFDS","BFGFR","FGFR-1","FLT-2","OGD","FGFBR","HH2","bFGF-R-1","CD331","KAL2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21160078","title":"Frequent and focal FGFR1 amplification associates with therapeutically tractable FGFR1 dependency in squamous cell lung cancer.","journal":"Science translational medicine","pubDate":"2010 Dec 15","volume":"2","issue":"62","pages":"62ra93","authors":"Weiss J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3001451","link":null,"reference":"Weiss J et al.
