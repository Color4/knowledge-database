PTPN11 is a member of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family of proteins (PMID: 18286234) and is comprised of three key domains: two SH2 domains (the N-terminal SH2 (N-SH2) and C-terminal SH2 (C-SH2) domains), and the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, followed by a proline-rich motif (PMID: 18286234). PTPN11 interacts with multiple cellular pathways and is required for activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway (PMID: 18286234). In its resting state, PTPN11 is suppressed by interactions between the N-SH2 domain and the PTP domain (PMID: 18286234). After growth factor or cytokine stimulation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), PTPN11 is recruited to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the RTK (PMID: 18286234). This causes conformational changes in PTPN11 that releases the N-SH2 domain from the PTP domain, resulting in the disinhibition of PTPN11. The exact molecular targets that PTP dephosphorylates are controversial, but PTP activity is required for RAS/ERK pathway activation. PTPN11 also acts as a negative regulator of PIK3/AKT activation in the EGFR signaling cascade. PTPN11 interacts with several other oncogenic pathways in various cancer models (PMID: 14644997), including MAPK (PMID: 24618081), STAT5 (PMID: 23103841) and RAS/RAF/ERK signaling (PMID: 25026279). Germline mutations in PTPN11 cause Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome, while somatic mutations are present in leukemias and are prevalent in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (PMID: 18286234, 16358218).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-06","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5781,"hugoSymbol":"PTPN11","name":"protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000351677","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002834.3","geneAliases":["JMML","CFC","SHP2","PTP2C","PTP-1D","NS1","BPTP3","METCDS","SH-PTP3","SH-PTP2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"14644997","title":"Mutations in PTPN11 implicate the SHP-2 phosphatase in leukemogenesis.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2004 Mar 15","volume":"103","issue":"6","pages":"2325-31","authors":"Loh ML et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Loh ML et al.
