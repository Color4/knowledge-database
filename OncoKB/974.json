The CD79 (Iga/Igb) complex is important for signaling from the BCR to support maturation and survival of B-cells throughout development (PMID:15186779, 8602530). The cytoplasmic portion of CD79B contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domains that become phosphorylated by SRC proto-oncogene family protein kinases. These regions serve as docking sites for signaling complex formation with kinases such as SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) and for signal regulation (PMID: 17114463, 20940318, 22078222). Activating mutations of CD79B have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly the activated B-cell-like subtype (PMID: 20054396) suggesting that CD79B acts as an oncogene. CD79B mutations result in increased surface BCR expression, reduced BCR internalization and dampening of LYN (Lyn proto-oncogene) kinase feedback inhibition, thus resulting in increased BCR signaling. Somatic mutation in the protein's ITAM domain have also been identified and shown to affect signaling (PMID: 20054396). Germline CD79B mutation leads to agammaglobulinemia, a severe immunodeficiency syndrome with B-cell dysfunction (PMID: 17709424). Antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD79B and inhibitors targeting SRC activity, such as dasatinib, can reduce BCR signaling (PMID: 17374736, 20054396, 25925619, 28009435).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":974,"hugoSymbol":"CD79B","name":"CD79b molecule","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000392795","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001039933.1","geneAliases":["AGM6","IGB","B29"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17114463","title":"Analysis of the individual contributions of Igalpha (CD79a)- and Igbeta (CD79b)-mediated tonic signaling for bone marrow B cell development and peripheral B cell maturation.","journal":"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","pubDate":"2006 Dec 1","volume":"177","issue":"11","pages":"7913-22","authors":"Fuentes-Pananá EM et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Fuentes-Pananá EM et al.
