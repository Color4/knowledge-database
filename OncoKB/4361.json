The complex activates the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related) to initiate DNA damage responses and is itself phosphorylated by ATM (PMID:23525106, 23582259, 26512707). MRE11A has DNA nuclease activity important for stimulating repair (PMID:18854157). Activation of the MRN complex enables the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA damage (PMID:14657032). The complex is also important for genomic integrity at telomeres, replication forks, immunoglobulin gene loci during rearrangements, and DNA breaks formed in meiosis (PMID:19667071, 21565612, 16285919, 17291760). Activation of repair mechanisms include non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair (PMID:12422221, 24316220). Mutations in MRE11A are associated with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, resulting in chromosomal instability and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (PMID:10612394). MRE11A is also a familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene and mutations have also been identified in endometrial, colorectal, and lymphoid cancers (PMID:19383352, 24549055, 24894818, 23755103, 11196167, 11850399, 16959974). MRE11A polymorphisms and mutations affect response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors (PMID:24623370, 25310185, 24927325, 24215868, 25324139, 24240112).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4361,"hugoSymbol":"MRE11A","name":"MRE11 homolog A, double strand break repair nuclease","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000323929","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005591.3","geneAliases":["HNGS1","ATLD","MRE11B"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18854157","title":"Mre11 nuclease activity has essential roles in DNA repair and genomic stability distinct from ATM activation.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"2008 Oct 3","volume":"135","issue":"1","pages":"85-96","authors":"Buis J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2008.08.015","link":null,"reference":"Buis J et al.
