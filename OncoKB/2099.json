ERα plays a major role in sexual reproductive development and maintenance, specifically in the female reproductive organs (PMID: 10368776). Binding of the hormone estrogen, the ERα ligand, induces conformational changes to ERα, which allows the receptor to dissociate from HSP90 and dimerize with itself or ERβ. The dimer then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to promoters and enhancers of target genes either directly, via Estrogen Responsive Elements (ERE) in the DNA, or via other transcription factor complexes such as FOS/JUN/SP-1 (PMID: 11162939, 10681512). Once bound, the estrogen receptor recruits co-regulators that modulate the transcription of ESR1 target genes, resulting in changes in proliferation, migration and differentiation (PMID: 21779010). Lack of ERα delays the development of WNT1- and ERBB2 mutant-induced mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 10213494, 12019156) and reduces the occurrence of estrogen and carcinogen-induced mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 20181624, 11156389), indicating the involvement of ERα in tumorigenesis. While mutations in ESR1 are generally very rare in primary cancers (<5%), a number of mutations occurring in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the receptor were identified in ~12-25% of hormone-resistant metastatic breast cancer patients (PMID: 24398047, 24185512, 24185510, 24217577). The most recurrent mutations, Y537S and D538G, result in a constitutively active receptor, which is shown to confer acquired resistance to estrogen deprivation therapies.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-08","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2099,"hugoSymbol":"ESR1","name":"estrogen receptor 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000206249","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001122740.1","geneAliases":["ESR","ESTRR","Era","ER","ESRA","NR3A1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21779010","title":"The different roles of ER subtypes in cancer biology and therapy.","journal":"Nature reviews.
