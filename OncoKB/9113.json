[{"evidenceId":4775,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"LATS1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a key role in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway (PMID: 20935475). Under physiologic conditions, activated Lats1 phosphorylates YAP1/TAZ transcription co-activators. Through such regulation, LATS1 controls their nuclear localization, thereby regulating expression of genes involved in various cellular functions, including proliferation and apoptosis (PMID: 20951342). Phosphorylating YAP1/TAZ and inhibiting the oncogenic signaling mediated by them are important roles of Lats1 in tumor suppression. Genetic alterations in LATS1 gene are found in a variety of human cancers, such as lung, cervical, stomach, melanoma and colorectal cancers. The most common point mutations in LATS1 gene are P237Q, R82*Q and R744*/L/Q (cBioportal, 5/1/2015). In addition, the promoter region of Lats1 gene is frequently hypermethylated in multiple types of human cancers. Such modification leads to decreased expression of Lats1.
