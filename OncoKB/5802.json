Specifically, PTPRS contains extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains thus constituting a receptor-like PTP. Additionally, PTPRS is considered a member of the leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) subfamily of PTPs, due to its role in development of the nervous system and evolutionary conservation (PMID: 15674434). PTPRS is seldom altered in cancer but its deregulation has been observed in several cancers, such as colorectal, head and neck and ovarian tumors, and it might act as a tumor suppressor through regulation of angiogenic and EMT processes (PMID: 16557282, 25998839, 26308964, 22065749).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5802,"hugoSymbol":"PTPRS","name":"protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type S","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000357368","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002850.3","geneAliases":["R-PTP-S","PTPSIGMA","R-PTP-sigma"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16557282","title":"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases and cancer.","journal":"Nature reviews.
