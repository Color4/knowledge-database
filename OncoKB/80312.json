[{"evidenceId":10222,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"TET1 is an iron- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme that is involved in converting 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (PMID: 19372391). This conversion of the DNA base to 5hmC is the initial step in active DNA methylation, which is important in gene regulation, cellular reprogramming, and mammalian development (PMID: 20639862). TET enzyme activity is inhibited by 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an inhibitory metabolite produced by specific mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 whose production results in a highly specific DNA methylation profile and is often found in certain glioblastomas and leukemias (PMID: 21383741). TET1 was first identified as a translocation partner of the MLL gene and a key oncogenic driver in acute myeloid leukemias (PMID: 23818607). Reduced TET1 expression has also been observed in various human cancers. In breast cancer, reduced TET1 levels were shown to associate with increased tumor growth and metastasis (PMID: 23716660), and in colon cancer cell lines, reduced TET1 expression was associated with an aberrant CpG methylation profile (PMID: 27977763). Reduced TET1 expression has also been associated with KRAS-induced cellular transformation (PMID: 25466250).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":80312,"hugoSymbol":"TET1","name":"tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000373644","curatedRefSeq":"NM_030625.2","geneAliases":["LCX","TET1-MLL","MLL-TET1","CXXC6","bA119F7.1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23818607","title":"TET1 plays an essential oncogenic role in MLL-rearranged leukemia.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2013 Jul 16","volume":"110","issue":"29","pages":"11994-9","authors":"Huang H et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.1310656110","link":null,"reference":"Huang H et al.
