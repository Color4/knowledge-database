SOS1 binds GRB2 and facilitates the activated RAS-GTP bound state, which in turn initiates the MAPK pathway signaling cascade (PMID: 8493579). SOS1 also activates RAC by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP (PMID: 9438849, 22042618). SOS1 mutations are rare events in cancers (PMID: 18064648; cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016). However, germline gain-of-function mutations in SOS1 are the cause of certain forms of Noonan syndrome, a hereditary disorder of congenital heart disease (PMID: 17143285, 17143282).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-06","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6654,"hugoSymbol":"SOS1","name":"SOS Ras/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000402219","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005633.3","geneAliases":["GINGF","GF1","GGF1","NS4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8493579","title":"Human Sos1: a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras that binds to GRB2.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"1993 May 28","volume":"260","issue":"5112","pages":"1338-43","authors":"Chardin P et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Chardin P et al.
