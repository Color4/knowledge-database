[{"evidenceId":17738,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CUL3 encodes a component of the E3-ubiquitin ligase complex, which covalently attaches ubiquitin to target identified proteins for subsequent target degradation by the 26S proteasome (PMID: 15071497). Proteins containing the BTB protein-protein interaction domain recruit degradation targets to the CUL3-containing E3-ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation (PMID: 17120193). CUL3 is also involved in the maturation of endosomes associated with lysosomal degradation, and depletion of CUL3 has been shown to impair endolysosomal trafficking (PMID: 22219362). Mutations in CUL3 are also associated with type II pseudohpoaldosteronism (PMID: 23689903). A prominent BTB-containing protein is KEAP1, which recruits the oxidative-stress signaling factor, NRF2, to the CUL3-containing E3-ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation. Mutations in NRF2, KEAP1, and CUL3 have been shown to disrupt the degradation of KEAP1, and subsequently up-regulate the oxidative stress response via KEAP1 and NRF2 and enhance survival of the tumor (PMID: 19321346, 19638449, 23365135).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8452,"hugoSymbol":"CUL3","name":"cullin 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000264414","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003590.4","geneAliases":["PHA2E","CUL-3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19638449","title":"Cul3 overexpression depletes Nrf2 in breast cancer and is associated with sensitivity to carcinogens, to oxidative stress, and to chemotherapy.","journal":"Molecular cancer therapeutics","pubDate":"2009 Aug","volume":"8","issue":"8","pages":"2432-40","authors":"Loignon M et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1186","link":null,"reference":"Loignon M et al.
