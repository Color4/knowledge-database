The TP53 family of transcription factors comprises of TP53, TP63 and TP73. All members share the same structure including an amino-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), a DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a carboxyterminal oligomerization domain (OD) (PMID: 20484388). TP63 exists in two protein variants either with the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) (=transactivating isoform) or without (N isoform) (PMID: 16601753). The transactivating isoform (TA) of TP63 exerts TP53-like tumor-suppressive activities through its ability to activate a common set of target genes (PMID: 16601753). The N isoform on the other hand can act as dominant-negative inhibitor of the transcriptionally active family members (PMID: 16601753). TP63 can therefore exhibit oncogenic as well as tumor suppressor functions depending on the isotype expressed.TP63 exhibits a unique role in the regulation of epithelial morphogenesis and epithelial stem cell maintenance and differentiation (PMID: 10227293, 10227294).TP63 has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression including inhibition of cancer metastasis(PMID: 21760596). TP63 is rarely mutated in cancer, however, it is found overexpressed and amplified in various carcinomas such as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (PMID: 17264681). Regulation of cell adhesion and tissue integrity may affect tumor metastasis and invasion (PMID: 20962848). Immunohistochemistry of TP63 is widely used for the diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma and can help distinguish malign and benign prostatic gland tissue (PMID: 24488880, 23165243, 21515338, 17334395, 17426453, 25085956).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8626,"hugoSymbol":"TP63","name":"tumor protein p63","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000264731","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003722.4","geneAliases":["OFC8","AIS","SHFM4","p63","B(p51B)","p40","p51","B(p51A)","p73H","EEC3","TP53CP","TP73L","LMS","p73L","TP53L","p53CP","KET","RHS","NBP"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23165243","title":"p63 the guardian of human reproduction.","journal":"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","pubDate":"2012 Dec 15","volume":"11","issue":"24","pages":"4545-51","authors":"Amelio I et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.4161/cc.22819","link":null,"reference":"Amelio I et al.
