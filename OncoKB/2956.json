[{"evidenceId":12053,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MSH6 (mutS homolog 6) gene encodes the DNA repair mismatch protein MSH6. MSH6 is a tumor suppressor which heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS-alpha. This complex recognizes single base pair mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops, initiating the mismatch repair (MMR) process (PMID: 8816473). MSH6 and other MMR genes are most notably implicated in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome (PMID: 428275, 1648437). Loss of function mutations or epigenetic silencing both in the germline and somatic context lead to an increased mutation rate that drives carcinogenesis as well as microsatellite instability (MSI). Although most commonly seen in colon cancer, MSH6 mutations have also been reported in a wide range of other cancer types and syndromes, including endometrial and uterine cancers (PMID: 19078925,16106253). Tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects have been predictive of clinical benefit to certain immune checkpoint blockade therapies (PMID: 26028255, 25409260). Recently, the FDA approved pembrolizumab (PD-1 blockade) for all mismatch repair deficient and microsatellite unstable (MSI-high) tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-07-31","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2956,"hugoSymbol":"MSH6","name":"mutS homolog 6","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000234420","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000179.2","geneAliases":["GTMBP","HNPCC5","p160","GTBP","HSAP"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"16106253","title":"The role of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 in the development of multiple colorectal cancers.","journal":"British journal of cancer","pubDate":"2005 Aug 22","volume":"93","issue":"4","pages":"472-7","authors":"Lawes DA et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lawes DA et al.
