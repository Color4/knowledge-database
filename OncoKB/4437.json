MSH3 partners with MSH2 to form the heterodimer MutS-beta, which is important for recognition and repair of mismatched base pairs, forming a DNA-MutS complex which signals other components of the MMR machinery to excise the aberrant nucleotide (PMID: 22179786, 8942985, 9679053). MSH3 deletion or loss-of-function mutations can result in MMR deficiency, leading to an increased mutation rate. MSH3 is altered in nearly 50% of MMR-deficient colorectal cancers by somatic frameshift mutations (PMID: 23724141,18922920,14871813, 9331106). Tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects have been predictive of clinical benefit to certain immune checkpoint blockade therapies (PMID: 26028255, 25409260). Recently, the FDA approved pembrolizumab (PD-1 blockade) for all mismatch repair deficient and microsatellite unstable (MSI-high) tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4437,"hugoSymbol":"MSH3","name":"mutS homolog 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000265081","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002439.4","geneAliases":["MRP1","DUP"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9331106","title":"Frameshift somatic mutations in gastrointestinal cancer of the microsatellite mutator phenotype.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"1997 Oct 1","volume":"57","issue":"19","pages":"4420-6","authors":"Yamamoto H et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Yamamoto H et al.
