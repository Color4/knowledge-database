Specifically, RHEB is thought to enact its activation upon mTORC1 via affecting the substrate affinity of mTORC1 for 4EBP1, a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway, resulting in protein synthesis activation (PMID: 19299511). RHEB is negatively regulated by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) which functionally activates the GTPase activity of RHEB causing exchange of the RHEB-bound GTP for GDP thus preventing RHEB from activating mTORC1 (PMID: 18708577). The TSC1/TSC2 complex is frequently mutated in human cancers, which allows for RHEB-associated upregulation of the mTOR pathway (PMID: 18708577, 15240005). RHEB is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is localized to the lysosomal membrane along with mTORC1 and the TSC1/TSC2 complex (PMID: 24863881, 14614311). Beyond its role in the regulation and activation of the mTORC1 complex, RHEB has been suggested to have multiple other non-canonical functions, including regulation of BRAF, as well as being important in developmental functions (PMID: 24863881, 21412983). RHEB has also been postulated to play a context-dependent role in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy (PMID: 24216995). RHEB is not a commonly mutated gene in human cancer, although hotspot, activating mutations have been discovered within the effector domain in a small number of renal cell carcinomas and endometrial cancers (PMID: 24390350, 24631838, cbioportal March, 2015). RHEB has, however, been shown to be overexpressed in multiple cancer types, including liver, lung, prostate, lymphoma and bladder cancer, and RHEB overexpression has been postulated to be associated with poor outcomes in breast cancers and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 18708577, 18708578, 20388784). This overexpression may result in part from copy number gains (RHEB is located at 7q36) or focal amplifications, which occur in numerous cancer types including ovarian (12%, cbioportal March, 2015). RHEB overexpression has been proposed to be a biomarker for response to mTOR pathway inhibitors (rapalogs), although clinical evidence for this is lacking at this time (PMID: 18708578, 24631838).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-20","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6009,"hugoSymbol":"RHEB","name":"Ras homolog enriched in brain","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262187","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005614.3","geneAliases":["RHEB2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21412983","title":"Non-canonical functions of the tuberous sclerosis complex-Rheb signalling axis.","journal":"EMBO molecular medicine","pubDate":"2011 Apr","volume":"3","issue":"4","pages":"189-200","authors":"Neuman NA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1002/emmm.201100131","link":null,"reference":"Neuman NA et al.
