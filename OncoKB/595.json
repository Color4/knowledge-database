[{"evidenceId":17532,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CCND1 gene encodes Cyclin D1, a protein that couples extracellular growth signaling to entry into the cell cycle through activating cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6 (PMID: 8114739). Upon complexing with CCND1, CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (RB), thus leading to the induction of a gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors (PMID: 12432268). CCND1 is not essential for entry into cell cycle progression (PMID: 15315760), however, its amplification/over-expression in human tumors is oncogenic (PMID: 20029424), because it allows cancer cells to proliferate independently of extracellular growth signaling cues (PMID: 23644662). Additional functions of cyclin D1 include control of cell growth, proliferation, transcription, DNA repair, and migration (reviewed in PMID: 21734724). Inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 are currently in clinical trials to treat tumors with CCND1 amplification (PMID: 24795392).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":595,"hugoSymbol":"CCND1","name":"cyclin D1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000227507","curatedRefSeq":"NM_053056.2","geneAliases":["PRAD1","D11S287E","BCL1","U21B31"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23644662","title":"Signaling through cyclin D-dependent kinases.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2014 Apr 10","volume":"33","issue":"15","pages":"1890-903","authors":"Choi YJ et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.137","link":null,"reference":"Choi YJ et al.
