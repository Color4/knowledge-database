[{"evidenceId":6044,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"ARID2 encodes a subunit in the Polybromo-associated BRG1-associated factor (PBAF) complex, a subtype of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes. PBAF complex facilitates nuclear receptor-mediated, ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by modulating chromatin structure to make DNA more accessible to transcription factors (PMID: 19234488, 11780067) and ARID2 is thought to confer specificity to the complex (PMID:15985610). The ARID2 protein contains a conserved N-terminal AT-rich DNA interaction domain, a Regulatory Factor X (RFX) DNA-binding domain, a proline and glutamine-rich domain, and two C-terminal zinc-finger motifs, which can bind to DNA, RNA and proteins (PMID:22095441). Most ARID2 mutations found in tumors are inactivating, suggesting ARID2 is a tumor suppressor gene. It is most commonly found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (18.2% of cases), where ARID2 mutations often lead to an inactive, truncated protein (PMID: 21822264). In HCC, ARID2 stop mutations and TP53 mutations were mutually exclusive (PMID: 21822264). ARID2 mutations are also found in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), each at a rate of ~5% (PMID: 23047306, 22817889). For melanoma and NSCLC, missense mutations are associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (PMID: 23047306).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-24","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":196528,"hugoSymbol":"ARID2","name":"AT-rich interaction domain 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000334344","curatedRefSeq":"NM_152641.2","geneAliases":["p200","BAF200"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"11780067","title":"Selectivity of chromatin-remodelling cofactors for ligand-activated transcription.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2001 Dec 20-27","volume":"414","issue":"6866","pages":"924-8","authors":"Lemon B et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lemon B et al.
