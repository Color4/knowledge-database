[{"evidenceId":19119,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ZFHX3 gene encodes a transcription factor that is expressed in brain, liver, lung and the gastro-intestinal tract. Normally, ZFHX3 suppresses transcription of alpha-fetoprotein by binding to an enhancer motif (PMID: 7507206, 11786962) and negatively regulates expression of the proto-oncogene MYB (PMID: 10318867). ZFHX3 is mutated in advanced gastric cancers (PMID: 17671116, 20599712) and prostate cancer (PMID: 15750593). Functional studies support a tumor suppressor role for this protein. Specifically, a ZFHX3 conditional knockout mouse develops hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PMID: 24934715). Suppression of ZFHX3 in a prostate cell line increases proliferation, while exogenous expression of ZFHX3 decreases soft agar colony formation (PMID: 15750593). In breast cancer, ZFHX3 is not frequently mutated (PMID: 16932943, 18796146), however, it can inhibit estrogen receptor-mediated cell proliferation (PMID: 20720010).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":463,"hugoSymbol":"ZFHX3","name":"zinc finger homeobox 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000268489","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006885.3","geneAliases":["ATBF1","ZNF927","ATBT"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11786962","title":"Regulation of the alpha-fetoprotein gene by the isoforms of ATBF1 transcription factor in human hepatoma.","journal":"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","pubDate":"2002 Jan","volume":"35","issue":"1","pages":"82-7","authors":"Ninomiya T et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Ninomiya T et al.
