[{"evidenceId":19321,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ERCC2 gene encodes a DNA helicase involved in DNA nucleotide excision repair. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is used by cells to repair bulky DNA lesions that are caused by environmental mutagens, UV irradiation and certain chemotherapeutics agents such as cisplatin (reviewed in PMID: 24086042). ERCC2 functions as an ATP-dependent 5' to 3' helicase that unwinds damaged DNA, enabling other NER factors to access the DNA for subsequent repair (PMID: 9351836). Germline mutations of ERCC2 lead to trichothiodystrophy, xeroderma pigmentosum and combined xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome (reviewed in PMID: 19809470). Genetic polymorphisms of ERCC2 are associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including lung (PMID: 20651612), colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 16707649) and urothelial cell carcinoma (PMID: 24347488). Somatic ERCC2 mutations occur in approximately ~12% of muscle invasive bladder cancer and have been associated with response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy (PMID: 24476821, 25096233).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2068,"hugoSymbol":"ERCC2","name":"ERCC excision repair 2, TFIIH core complex helicase subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000391945","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000400.3","geneAliases":["EM9","TTD","TFIIH","TTD1","COFS2","XPD"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24476821","title":"Comprehensive molecular characterization of urothelial bladder carcinoma.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2014 Mar 20","volume":"507","issue":"7492","pages":"315-22","authors":"Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature12965","link":null,"reference":"Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network..
