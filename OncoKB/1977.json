[{"evidenceId":19597,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"EIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ) is located on chromosome 4q23 and encodes a member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex. The eIF4F complex additionally consists of an EIF4A isoform and EIF4G and directs the ribosome to the 5' 7-methylguanosine cap of mRNAs in what is considered a rate-limiting step of translation (PMID: 291969, 3469651). As a vital part of translation initiation, EIF4E controls cellular size and in that context is thought to be an direct target of mTOR which can phosphorylate the translational repressor 4EBP1, which allows for EIF4E to enter the eIF4F complex (PMID: 12080086). Overexpression of EIF4E has been detected in tumors of the breast, bladder, colon, lung, and cervix and can cause malignant transformation in in vitro studies (PMID: 9330633, 9285563, 8244582, 7829225, 25986608, 10638984, 11401917, 12374671, 16260273, 16280668, 20049173). Furthermore, EIF4E exhibits oncogenic traits in a mouse-model of lymphoma and is implicated in drug resistance both in contexts of mTOR, BRAF, and MEK targeting (PMID: 15029198, 16103051, 25079330, 25422161, 25615552). Thusly, EIF4E is considered a therapeutical target in certain tumor types on the principles that translational control often is deregulated in cancer cells and that PI3K and mTOR signaling and MAPK-interacting kinases (MNKs) are involved in this process (PMID: 22474009, 25743081, 25425688). A variant in the promoter region of EIF4E has been identified in two families with autistic children (PMID: 19556253).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1977,"hugoSymbol":"EIF4E","name":"eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000280892","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001130678.1","geneAliases":["CBP","eIF-4E","EIF4EL1","EIF4F","AUTS19","EIF4E1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22474009","title":"Emerging therapeutics targeting mRNA translation.","journal":"Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology","pubDate":"2012 Apr 1","volume":"4","issue":"4","pages":"a012377","authors":"Malina A et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a012377","link":null,"reference":"Malina A et al.
