Chromatin is the physiological template of human genetic information and is built out of nucleosomes, which are octamers assembled from histones proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (PMID: 11498575). The exact functions of histone 3.3 are not yet fully understood. Mutations of H3F3A leading to amino acid substitutions at its histone tail are common in pediatric glioblastoma (GBM) and pediatric diffuse pontine glioma and were also reported in chondroblastoma and giant cell tumors (PMID: 22286061, 22286216, 24162739, 24285547, 26399631). Glioblastoma tumors with H3F3A mutations show a different DNA methylation profile when compared to other GBM tumors and H3F3A mutations seem mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutations in GBM (PMID: 23079654). The exact mechanism by which these mutations lead to tumorigenesis are unknown, however, it has been proposed that H3.3 mutations lead to increased expression of oncogenic MYCN (PMID: 23539269).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3020,"hugoSymbol":"H3F3A","name":"H3 histone, family 3A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000366813","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002107.4","geneAliases":["H3F3","H3.3A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11498575","title":"Translating the histone code.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2001 Aug 10","volume":"293","issue":"5532","pages":"1074-80","authors":"Jenuwein T et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Jenuwein T et al.
