[{"evidenceId":18020,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The JAK1 gene encodes Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), a ubiquitously expressed member of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases (PMID: 25057888, 9096349). JAK1 forms a complex with cytokine receptors to initiate cytokine-mediated signaling. Upon cytokine activation, JAK1 forms oligodimers which phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic region of the cytokine receptors, leading to recruitment and activation of downstream targets such as STAT1-6 (PMID: 25057888). The STAT proteins then translocate to the nucleus and act as transcription factors, mediating several cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation and antigen presentation (PMID: 23406773). Several activating mutations in JAK1 have been detected in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematological malignancies, and inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway have been suggested as potential therapy in those cases (PMID: 23340138). On the other hand, truncating mutations leading to loss-of-function of JAK1 have been reported in gynecologic tumors, and are suggested to mediate immune escape by causing impaired tumor antigen presentation (PMID: 24154688).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-07-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3716,"hugoSymbol":"JAK1","name":"Janus kinase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000342505","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002227.2","geneAliases":["JTK3","JAK1B","JAK1A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9096349","title":"Jak1 kinase is required for cell migrations and anterior specification in zebrafish embryos.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"1997 Apr 1","volume":"94","issue":"7","pages":"3082-7","authors":"Conway G et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Conway G et al.
