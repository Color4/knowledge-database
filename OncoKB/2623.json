[{"evidenceId":19627,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"GATA1 encodes for the gene GATA binding protein 1 that acts as a transcription factor (PMID:1987478). GATA1 activates many critical genes involved in erythroid and megakaryocyte development (PMID:7568185, 7823932), including the beta globin gene and erythropoietin receptor (PMID:1924329, 1660143). Germline mutation in GATA1 is associated with anemia, thrombocytopenia and porphyria (PMID:10700180, 11675338, 16783379, 17148589). Mutation in GATA1 and reduced translation of GATA1 can also lead to Diamond Blackfan anemia (PMID:24952648). The gene is located on the X-chromosome, and thus associated diseases are sex-linked disorders. In patients with Down Syndrome, mutations in GATA1 are observed with acute megakaryocytic leukemia development and transient myeloid disorders (PMID:12172547, 12747884). In solid tumors, select studies suggest GATA1 can regulate tumor aggressiveness and DNA repair (PMID:20101202, 17332341,25230694).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2623,"hugoSymbol":"GATA1","name":"GATA binding protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000376670","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002049.3","geneAliases":["NFE1","GF-1","GF1","XLANP","ERYF1","XLTDA","GATA-1","NF-E1","XLTT"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12747884","title":"Acquired mutations in GATA1 in neonates with Down's syndrome with transient myeloid disorder.","journal":"Lancet (London, England)","pubDate":"2003 May 10","volume":"361","issue":"9369","pages":"1617-20","authors":"Groet J et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Groet J et al.
