ALOX12B also demonstrates immunosuppressive activity by decreasing antigen presentation on T cells (PMID: 22503541). Inactivating mutations in ALOX12B have been observed in autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by dried, scaling skin (PMID: 11773004, 16116617, 15629692, 19131948, 17139268). Missense and nonsense mutations of ALOX12B are found in a wide range of cancers, including melanoma and other skin cancers (cBioportal, MSKCC, July 2017). Deletions and amplifications of ALOX12B are also observed in various cancers. In a recent study, amplification of ALOX12B in breast and ovarian cancer was associated with reduced cytolytic activity by the immune system (PMID: 25594174).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-07-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":242,"hugoSymbol":"ALOX12B","name":"arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000319144","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001139.2","geneAliases":["ARCI2","12R-LOX"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22503541","title":"12/15-lipoxygenase orchestrates the clearance of apoptotic cells and maintains immunologic tolerance.","journal":"Immunity","pubDate":"2012 May 25","volume":"36","issue":"5","pages":"834-46","authors":"Uderhardt S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2012.03.010","link":null,"reference":"Uderhardt S et al.
