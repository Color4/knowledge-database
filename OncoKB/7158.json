TP53BP1 plays a role in DNA damage recognition and DNA repair (PMID: 12364621, 21144835, 17190600, 18804090). Tumor suppressor roles for TP53BP1 have been described in several cancers, mostly related to functions of TP53, BRCA1 and ATM, although some contradictory results exist (PMID: 15970701, 17546051, 15279780, 12447382, 22266878, 20453858, 24681733).
