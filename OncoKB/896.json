[{"evidenceId":10848,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CCND3 gene encodes Cyclin D3, a protein that couples extracellular growth signaling to entry into the cell cycle through activating cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6 (PMID: 8114739). Upon complexing with CCND1, CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (RB), thus leading to the induction of a gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors (PMID: 12432268). However, CCND3 (like CCND1 and CCND2) is not essential for entry into the cell cycle (PMID: 15315760). Like Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3 is also known to inhibit the activity of androgen receptor (AR) and peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ (PPAR-γ). Unlike CCND1, CCND3 is rarely amplified in human cancers (PMID: 21734724). Given the strong link between aberrant CDK4/6 activity and cancer cell proliferation, therapeutics targeting CDK4/6 have been intensely investigated. In 2015, the first CDK4/6 inhibitor was FDA-approved for the treatment of breast cancer (fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm432886; June 2015); other inhibitors are currently in clinical trials to treat tumors with CCND1 amplification and other mutations that impact CDK4/6 activity (PMID: 24795392). However, their utility in treating cancers with CCND3 amplification specifically has not been investigated.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":896,"hugoSymbol":"CCND3","name":"cyclin D3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000372991","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001760.3","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8114739","title":"Identification of G1 kinase activity for cdk6, a novel cyclin D partner.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"1994 Mar","volume":"14","issue":"3","pages":"2077-86","authors":"Meyerson M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Meyerson M et al.
