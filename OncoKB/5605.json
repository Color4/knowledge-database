As a second component of a three-tiered MAP kinase cascade, MAP2K2 activity is dependent on phosphorylation of two serine residues (S222 and S226) catalyzed by upstream RAF kinases, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family. Activated MAP2K2 in turn phosphorylates ERKs (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases) (PMID: 22177953). These signaling events are triggered by growth factors, cytokines and hormones that activate upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, ultimately leading to altered expression of key regulators of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 9069255, 11242034). Germline missense mutations and deletions in MAP2K2 are found in patients with cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (PMID: 20358587, 18456719, 21178588, 24311457, 23379592). Hyperactivation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is frequently observed in human cancers; nevertheless, oncogenic mutations in MAP2K2 in primary tumors are infrequent (PMID: 24840079; cBioPortal, MSKCC, Apr. 2015). Because of its major role in signaling as a RAF oncogene effector, several inhibitors of wildtype MAP2K2 and its close structural and functional homologue, MAP2K1, have been developed (PMID: 20149254, 24840079). Trametinib has been approved for treatment of BRAF V600E/K positive melanoma (PMID: 22663011, US FDA NDA 204114). Point mutations in MAP2K2 are often identified in BRAF positive melanomas insensitive to RAF and MEK inhibitors and are thought to be responsible for the resistance to MAPK pathway targeted agents (PMID: 24265153, 24055054, 22197931).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5605,"hugoSymbol":"MAP2K2","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262948","curatedRefSeq":"NM_030662.3","geneAliases":["MKK2","PRKMK2","MAPKK2","CFC4","MEK2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18456719","title":"Noonan and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes: two clinically and genetically overlapping disorders.","journal":"Journal of medical genetics","pubDate":"2008 Aug","volume":"45","issue":"8","pages":"500-6","authors":"Nyström AM et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1136/jmg.2008.057653","link":null,"reference":"Nyström AM et al.
