Unique from its family members, EPHA5 is almost exclusively expressed in the nervous systemâ€”specifically in cortical neurons, cerebellar Purkinje cells and pyramidal neurons of the cortex and hippocampus (PMID: 10375373, 7898646, 9191074). EPHA5 plays a major role in brain development, from neurogenesis to plasticity (PMID: 19326470, 20824214, 9530499, 9698392, 9321686). In addition to its role in the nervous system, EPHA5 mediates communication between pancreatic islet cells, thereby regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (PMID: 17448994). Downregulation of EPHA5 due to promoter methylation has been observed in both breast and prostate cancer, and it has been suggested that EPHA5 might represent a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of these tumor types (PMID: 19733895, 25609195). Aberrant methylation of the EPHA5 promoter was observed in 91% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in particular in older patients (PMID: 23757320). Increased expression and somatic mutations of EPHA5 have been observed in ovarian cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and lung cancer, among others (PMID: 25623065, 19949912, 19956396, 25634010).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2044,"hugoSymbol":"EPHA5","name":"EPH receptor A5","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000273854","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004439.5","geneAliases":["EK7","CEK7","EHK-1","HEK7","EHK1","TYRO4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9321686","title":"Regulation of topographic projection by the Eph family receptor Bsk (EphA5) and its ligands.","journal":"Cell and tissue research","pubDate":"1997 Nov","volume":"290","issue":"2","pages":"251-9","authors":"Zhou R","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Zhou R.
