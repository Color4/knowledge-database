PALB2 acts as a scaffold protein in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, likely mediating recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 at damaged loci (PMID: 19423707). PALB2 also interacts with BRCA1, possibly functioning as an intermediary factor between BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the HR pathway (PMID: 19268590, 19584259). Preclinical data show that mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 can abrogate interaction with PALB2 and disrupt HR-mediated DNA repair (PMID: 19369211, 16793542). Germline biallelic mutations of PALB2 are linked to the hereditary disease Fanconi Anemia, which predisposes to various cancers (PMID: 20858716 ,17200671, 17200672). PALB2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene with some indications for a lesser effect in ovarian, pancreatic, prostate cancer and melanoma (PMID: 17200668, 17287723, 17420451, 18053174, 25099575, 20858716, 19264984, 24448499). Although rare, deleterious somatic variants in PALB2 are observed across various tumor types.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":79728,"hugoSymbol":"PALB2","name":"partner and localizer of BRCA2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000261584","curatedRefSeq":"NM_024675.3","geneAliases":["FANCN","PNCA3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25099575","title":"Breast-cancer risk in families with mutations in PALB2.","journal":"The New England journal of medicine","pubDate":"2014 Aug 7","volume":"371","issue":"6","pages":"497-506","authors":"Antoniou AC et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1400382","link":null,"reference":"Antoniou AC et al.
