[{"evidenceId":18993,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RBM10 encodes a nuclear protein that belongs to a family of proteins with RNA-binding motif. RBM10 is located on the X chromosome and therefore subject to X-inactivation whereby the remaining active allele is widely expressed in human cell lines and tissues (PMID: 11944989, 15514923). Mutations that result in a truncated RBM10 protein are identified as the causes of TARP (Talipes equinovarus, Atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, and Persistent left superior vena cava) syndrome, which has been reported to cause pre- or postnatal death in affected males (PMID: 20451169, 21910224, 24000153). RBM10 was discovered to be among the most frequently mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma samples (PMID: 22980975, 25079552); mutations in this gene have also been observed in breast, colon, ovary, pancreas and prostate cancers (PMID: 20668451, 16959974). RBM10 has been characterized as an RNA-binding protein both in vitro and in vivo, and identified as an important regulator of alternative splicing (PMID: 24000153, 24332178). Recently, RBM10 has been shown to regulate alternative splicing of FAS and Bcl-X, two genes involved in apoptosis (PMID: 24530524).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8241,"hugoSymbol":"RBM10","name":"RNA binding motif protein 10","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000329236","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001204468.1","geneAliases":["GPATCH9","S1-1","TARPS","DXS8237E","GPATC9","ZRANB5"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"16959974","title":"The consensus coding sequences of human breast and colorectal cancers.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2006 Oct 13","volume":"314","issue":"5797","pages":"268-74","authors":"Sjöblom T et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sjöblom T et al.
