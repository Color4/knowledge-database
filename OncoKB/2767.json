G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane complexes comprising seven domains and are activated by a variety of agonists (e.g., lipids or small proteins), depending on the GPCR type. Upon activation, a conformational change facilitates activation of membrane-bound, intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins, which are composed of three subunits (α, β, γ). The G-protein is decoupled into active G-alpha and G-beta-gamma subunits, which are released from the agonist-activated GPCR and participate in various intracellular signaling pathways; G protein activation may also occur independently of GPCR. The G-alpha subunit, bound to GDP when inactive, exchanges GDP for GTP in the activated state. GNA11 encodes a specific q-class subtype of the G-protein alpha subunit (PMID: 23640210, 24141786). GTP-bound GNA11 activates downstream signaling partners, which include PLCγ. Via secondary messenger generation, PLCγ activates PKC, which activates the MAPK signaling cascade, which in turn mediates cell proliferation. Mutations of GNA11 inactivate the GTPase activity of the protein, thereby causing GNA11 to remain bound to GTP in a constitutively activated state (PMID: 24077403), which consequently amplifies the signaling downstream of the GPCR independent of agonist binding to the receptor. Somatic gene mutations in GNA11 specifically are noted in 1% of cutaneous melanoma and 36% of uveal melanomas (PMID: 24077403, 21083380). Mutually exclusive mutations of either GNA11 or GNAQ have been found in approximately 85% of uveal melanomas (PMID: 24713608).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2767,"hugoSymbol":"GNA11","name":"G protein subunit alpha 11","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000078429","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002067.2","geneAliases":["GNA-11","FBH2","HYPOC2","FHH2","FBH","HHC2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23640210","title":"The emerging mutational landscape of G proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors in cancer.","journal":"Nature reviews.
