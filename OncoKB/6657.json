It functions as an activator or suppressor of gene transcription through a highly specific DNA binding (high-mobility group) domain (PMID: 20016762). Together with Oct-4 and Nanog, Sox2 positive regulates transcription of pluripotency factors involved in the Leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathway (PMID:19571885). SOX2 has recently been implicated in cancer development, by promoting oncogenic signaling and maintaining cancer stem cells. It has been shown to promote cellular proliferation in breast (PMID: 22561374), prostate (PMID: 24659665), pancreatic (PMID: 23917223) and cervical cancers (PMID: 21415100); and to evade apoptotic signaling in prostate (PMID: 24325912), gastric cancer (PMID: 21415100) and non small cell lung cancer (PMID: 24233838). SOX2 has also been associated with an increased in the metastatic potential of these cancers (PMID: 22069467, 22184093, 22912670, 23895273). SOX2 amplification is observed in several cancer types including glioblastoma, small-cell lung cancer and many forms of squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 20126410, 21518820, 22069467, 20372069, 19801978, 21334718, 22941189, 19787784). Its heterozygous mutations have been associated with developmental disorders, such as aanophthalmia-esophagel-genital (AEG) syndrome (PMID: 16543359) and syndromic microphthalmia, a structural eye malformation (PMID: 23463581).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6657,"hugoSymbol":"SOX2","name":"SRY-box 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000325404","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003106.3","geneAliases":["ANOP3","MCOPS3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16543359","title":"Mutations in SOX2 cause anophthalmia-esophageal-genital (AEG) syndrome.","journal":"Human molecular genetics","pubDate":"2006 May 1","volume":"15","issue":"9","pages":"1413-22","authors":"Williamson KA et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Williamson KA et al.
