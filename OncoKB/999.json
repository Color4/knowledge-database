E-cadherin is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein that is mainly expressed in epithelial cells. Functions of E-cadherin in normal tissues include cell-cell adhesion, signaling cascades and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The extracellular portion of E-cadherin is composed of Ca2+ binding repeat regions that facilitate homophilic cell-to-cell adhesion by binding to cadherins on adjacent cells (PMID: 7885471). The carboxy-terminal intracellular domain is tethered to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with catenins and functions to activate signaling cascades that play a role in the EMT (PMID: 2788574). The transcription factor SNAIL, a key regulator of the EMT during embryonic development, represses expression of the E-cadherin gene in tumor cell lines (PMID: 10655586, 10655587). Downregulation or loss of E-cadherin results in cells acquiring a more motile and invasive cellular phenotype (PMID: 2070412, 9515965). The CDH1 gene is a tumor suppressor. Rather than loss of heterozygosity, epigenetic allelic inactivation by hypermethylation of the CDH1 promoter has been identified as the main cause of inactivation of the remaining allele. CDH1 truncating and missense mutations within the E-cadherin calcium channel are hypothesized to disrupt normal protein function and prevent proper cell-to-cell adhesion (PMID: 9744472). Lack of E-cadherin function is hypothesized to enable cancer progression through lack of adhesion-mediated growth inhibition (PMID: 17522512, 8033105, 7748170, 10439038, 2257621). Individuals with a heterogeneous germline CDH1 mutation have a 67-83% lifetime risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer by the age of 80, and women have an additional 39% lifetime risk to develop breast cancer, with lobular breast cancer being the most characteristic (PMID: 11729114). Loss of E-cadherin has also been demonstrated in a variety of sporadic cancer types including gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer and esophageal cancer (PMID: 11313896, 21552209, 18837082, 22716209, 21373750).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-27","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":999,"hugoSymbol":"CDH1","name":"cadherin 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000261769","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004360.3","geneAliases":["LCAM","CDHE","ECAD","CD324","Arc-1","UVO"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"7885471","title":"Structural basis of cell-cell adhesion by cadherins.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"1995 Mar 23","volume":"374","issue":"6520","pages":"327-37","authors":"Shapiro L et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Shapiro L et al.
