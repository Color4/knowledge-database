[{"evidenceId":17815,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"KMT2D encodes the histone methyltransferase MLL2, an epigenetic modulator that methylates lysine residue 4 on the tail of histone H3 (H3K4). Methylation of H3K4 leads to increased genome accessibility, recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and activation of gene expression (PMID: 25998713). Deletion of MLL2 in human cells leads to genomic instability due to transcriptional stress (PMID: 26883360). In murine models, loss of MLL2 results in accelerated B cell malignancy, impaired B cell differentiation, and defects in class switching (PMID: 26366710). MLL2 activity is critical for the survival and proliferation of MLL1-rearranged leukemias (PMID: 28609655). Though MLL2 is not as commonly mutated as MLL1 in human cancers, MLL2 is one of the most recurrently mutated genes in follicular and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PMID: 24476821, 21804550, 21796119, 24476821).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8085,"hugoSymbol":"KMT2D","name":"lysine methyltransferase 2D","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000301067","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003482.3","geneAliases":["AAD10","KABUK1","MLL2","TNRC21","ALR","CAGL114"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24476821","title":"Comprehensive molecular characterization of urothelial bladder carcinoma.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2014 Mar 20","volume":"507","issue":"7492","pages":"315-22","authors":"Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature12965","link":null,"reference":"Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network..
