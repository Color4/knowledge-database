ARID1B can substitute for ARID1A in BAF complexes making these two proteins mutually exclusive components of the complex despite ARID1A being more commonly present (PMID: 15170388). Like ARID1A, germline mutations in ARID1B result in Coffin-Siris syndrome (PMID: 22426308, 22426309). Some patients with germline ARID1B mutations or deletions may present with early-onset malignancy such as papillary thyroid cancer that was found in a 27 year-old man with a germline 6q25 deletion that included the ARID1B locus (PMID: 24700687). Inactivating ARID1B mutations have been identified in breast cancer (PMID: 22722201), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 22634756), gynecologic carcinosarcoma (PMID: 25233892), pancreatic cancer (PMID: 22233809) and medulloblastoma (PMID: 22820256). In neuroblastoma, the most frequent alteration seen was intragenic deletion resulting in either a frameshift mutation or removal of the start site, both of which are predicted to result in loss of function (PMID: 23202128). ARID1B was identified as a specific vulnerability in ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, suggesting that ARID1B may be a therapeutic target for cancers with inactivating ARID1A mutations (PMID: 24562383).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-24","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":57492,"hugoSymbol":"ARID1B","name":"AT-rich interaction domain 1B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000346085","curatedRefSeq":"NM_020732.3","geneAliases":["OSA2","CSS1","MRD12","BAF250B","6A3-5","DAN15","ELD/OSA1","P250R","BRIGHT"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22426308","title":"Mutations affecting components of the SWI/SNF complex cause Coffin-Siris syndrome.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2012 Mar 18","volume":"44","issue":"4","pages":"376-8","authors":"Tsurusaki Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.2219","link":null,"reference":"Tsurusaki Y et al.
