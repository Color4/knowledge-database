[{"evidenceId":17746,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CEBPA encodes a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that can homo- or heterodimerizes to bind DNA and activates transcription (PMID: 25753223). Through interactions by its transactivation domain, it can help recruit the RNA polymerase complex, coactivators CBP (Creb binding protein) /p300, and chromatin modifying complexes SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) (PMID: 12857754, 14660596). CEBPA gene regulation is important for the differentiation of diverse cell types including hematopoietic, adiopose, liver and epithelial cells (PMID: 7652557, 23160954, 12757710). In lung cancer, CEBPA may suppress tumorigenesis (PMID: 17638888). In hematopoiesis, CEBPA is important for the development of the myeloid lineage and granulocytic differentiation by regulating specific growth factor receptors and cell cycle arrest (PMID: 25753223). CEBPA mutations are found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in inherited AML predisposition syndromes (PMID: 11242107, 12351377, 25311743, 23560626).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-22","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1050,"hugoSymbol":"CEBPA","name":"CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000498907","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004364.3","geneAliases":["C/EBP-alpha","CEBP"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"12351377","title":"Favorable prognostic significance of CEBPA mutations in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia: a study from the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA).","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2002 Oct 15","volume":"100","issue":"8","pages":"2717-23","authors":"Preudhomme C et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Preudhomme C et al.
