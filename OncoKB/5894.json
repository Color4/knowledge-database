In response to extracellular stimuli, RAS-mediated signaling induces dimer formation of CRAF leading to phosphorylation of MEK and subsequently ERK, which stimulates a wide range of cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation and migration (PMID: 21779496). CRAF is ubiquitously expressed and is necessary for normal physiology in several tissues, despite partly overlapping functions with ARAF and BRAF (PMID: 9767153). Mutations in RAF1 occur in low frequency in different cancers, including uterine, stomach and colorectal carcinoma and malignant melanoma (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2015). The most common oncogenic RAF1 mutation is S257L/W, which causes increased MAPK signaling and oncogenic transformation in vitro, suggesting its role as a driving mutation (PMID: 24957944; cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2015). Also, rare oncogenic fusion genes involving RAF1 with transforming potential have been found in different types of cancer (PMID: 19363522, 20526349, 25266736).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5894,"hugoSymbol":"RAF1","name":"Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000251849","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002880.3","geneAliases":["NS5","c-Raf","CMD1NN","Raf-1","CRAF"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17555829","title":"Raf kinases: function, regulation and role in human cancer.","journal":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","pubDate":"2007 Aug","volume":"1773","issue":"8","pages":"1196-212","authors":"Leicht DT et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Leicht DT et al.
