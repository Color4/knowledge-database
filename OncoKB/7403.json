[{"evidenceId":4980,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"the KDM6A gene (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) encodes a chromatin-modifying enzyme that mediates transcriptional co-activation by functioning as a di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase. KDM6A is part of the larger ASC-2 complex (ASCOM) that also contains lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C). KDM6A is located on Xp11.2, but it escapes X inactivation, resulting in bi-allelic expression in females (PMID: 9499428). Association of KDM6A with KMT2D and KMT2C couples H3K27 demethylation to H3K4 methylation (PMID: 17761849). Germline deletions and point mutations in KDM6A cause Kabuki syndrome, which is characterized by typical facial features, skeletal anomalies, dermatoglyphic abnormalities, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and postnatal short stature (PMID: 22197486, 22840376, 22901312, 23076834). Early sequencing efforts led to the discovery of inactivating KDM6A mutations in a number of human malignancies including multiple myeloma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 19330029). Later studies found KDM6A mutations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 21248752), medulloblastoma (PMID: 22722829, 22832583), adenoid cystic carcinoma (PMID: 23685749), urothelial bladder cancer (PMID: 24476821, 21822268, 25092538, 25225064), aristolochic acid-associated upper tract urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 23926199), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25320243), and pancreatic cancer (PMID: 25719666). In prostate cancer, KDM6A mutations are seen in progression to lethal castration-resistant disease (PMID: 22722839).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7403,"hugoSymbol":"KDM6A","name":"lysine demethylase 6A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000377967","curatedRefSeq":"NM_021140.2","geneAliases":["UTX","bA386N14.2","KABUK2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"23685749","title":"The mutational landscape of adenoid cystic carcinoma.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2013 Jul","volume":"45","issue":"7","pages":"791-8","authors":"Ho AS et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.2643","link":null,"reference":"Ho AS et al.
