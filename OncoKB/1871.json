[{"evidenceId":19679,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"E2F3 (E2F transcription factor 3) is a member of the E2F family of transcription factors and is located on chromosome 6p22. E2F3 is related to E2F1 and E2F2 with which it shares similar DNA-binding, RB protein-binding, dimerization, and transcriptional activation domains (PMID: 8246996). E2F1-3 also bind induce transcription from to the same E2F recognition motifs in vitro and associate with RB. (PMID: 8246996). Additionally, E2F1-3 are considered inducers of gene expression and their transcription and proteasomal degradation are controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner as opposed to the constitutively expressed transcriptional repressors E2F4-6 (PMID: 12748276). E2F proteins play overlapping roles in various processes, including DNA replication, progression through from G1 to S stages of the cell cycle, and cell-fate determination but they also appear to have certain distinct functions (PMID: 12748276, 9679057). The RB/E2F axis is considered a pivotal in activating DNA replication and G1/S transition in a manner dependent on RB's inhibitory effect on E2F proteins (PMID: 8246996, 11257102, 9365528). E2F3-specific activity includes TFE3 binding and DDX5 induction, mediation of MYC-induced transition to S phase (together with E2F2), and induction of specific target genes (PMID: 12748276, 10733529, 11511364) E2F3-deficient mice exhibit impaired growth and cell proliferation (PMID: 10733529). Amplification and subsequent overexpression of E2F3 has been observed in prostate and bladder cancer as well as lung cancer and metastatic urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 14716298, 15122326, 18037967, 16953223, 16938365, 15184867, 16909110, 24476821, 25886454). Also, E2F3 appears to be a target for the ETS fusions in certain cancers (PMID: 23940108).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1871,"hugoSymbol":"E2F3","name":"E2F transcription factor 3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000346618","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001949.4","geneAliases":["E2F-3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11511364","title":"Myc requires distinct E2F activities to induce S phase and apoptosis.","journal":"Molecular cell","pubDate":"2001 Jul","volume":"8","issue":"1","pages":"105-13","authors":"Leone G et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Leone G et al.
