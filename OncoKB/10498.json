[{"evidenceId":2403,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CARM1 gene encodes a methyltransferase protein that modifies arginines seventeen and 26 of histones and other proteins. CARM1 is recruited, along with EP300 and the NCOA-family of histone acetyltransferases, to active gene promoters, playing a role in transcriptional activation via chromatin remodeling (PMID: 16497732, 19405910). CARM1 is a positive regulator of Wnt/β-catenin expression, induces growth and proliferation in colon cancer cells (PMID: 21478268), and synergistically co-activates NF-kB pathway with EP300 in fibroblasts (PMID: 15616592). CARM1 is amplified in a small subset of cancers, such as neuroendocrine, prostate and ovarian tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-25","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10498,"hugoSymbol":"CARM1","name":"coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000327064","curatedRefSeq":"NM_199141.1","geneAliases":["PRMT4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15616592","title":"Arginine methyltransferase CARM1 is a promoter-specific regulator of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression.","journal":"The EMBO journal","pubDate":"2005 Jan 12","volume":"24","issue":"1","pages":"85-96","authors":"Covic M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Covic M et al.
