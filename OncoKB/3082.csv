19215,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"HGF (hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor) is a multidomain protein that directly binds to the tyrosine kinase MET, which leads to its dimerization and activation (PMID: 3319692, 2531289). HGF is primarily expressed as pro-HGF and needs proteolytic activation to form HGF (PMID: 22270953, 1826653). MET activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of various effector proteins such as PLC, GAB1, GRB2 and SRC. HGF/MET signaling is physiolgically required for liver and skin regeneration as well as Epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) in embryogenesis. In cancer, HGF/MET signaling is involved in stemness, metastasis and angiogenesis (PMID: 22270953). Downstream effectors in the context of cancer involve the WNT-beta-catenin pathway, PI3K-AKT as well as TGFbeta signalling. A number of small molecule and antibody based MET receptor inhibitors have been developed and are tested in clinical trials with variable results.",,2017-03-01,,3082,HGF,hepatocyte growth factor,True,ENST00000222390,NM_000601.4,F-TCF,DFNB39,HPTA,HGFB,False,22270953,Targeting MET in cancer: rationale and progress.,Nature reviews.
