[{"evidenceId":19647,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ELF3 gene encodes a member of the ETS-family of transcription factors. ELF3 binds ETS-consensus sequences, present in many gene promoters, either activating or repressing their transcription in physiological conditions (PMID: 21548782, 10773884). ELF3 both activates NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathways and represses androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancers, leading to cancer progression and increased cell migration, respectively (PMID: 23687337, 23435425). ELF3 regulates β-catenin transcription in colorectal cancer (PMID: 24874735). ELF3 has a particularly important role in the mammary gland (PMID: 10959418) and ELF3 amplifications are frequent events in breast cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016). In addition, oncogenic inactivating mutations in ELF3 have been identified in ampullary cancers (PMID: 26806338).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1999,"hugoSymbol":"ELF3","name":"E74 like ETS transcription factor 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000359651","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004433.4","geneAliases":["ERT","ESE-1","EPR-1","ESX"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23687337","title":"ETS transcription factor ESE1/ELF3 orchestrates a positive feedback loop that constitutively activates NF-κB and drives prostate cancer progression.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2013 Jul 15","volume":"73","issue":"14","pages":"4533-47","authors":"Longoni N et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4537","link":null,"reference":"Longoni N et al.
