NUTM1 is a novel gene located on chromosome 15; not much is known about its function, except that the protein harbors an acidic binding domain for the acetyltransferase p300 (PMID: 20676058). Most of the current knowledge on NUTM1 is focused on alterations involved in cancer (PMID: 17934517). More specifically, chromosomal translocations involving NUT and BRD proteins—in particular BRD4, but also BRD3—are found in NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), a rare, aggressive, and lethal genetically defined epithelial cancer syndrome, characterized by the insurgence of carcinomas in various tissues along the upper midline of the body, that mainly affects young individuals (PMID: 17934517, 26551281, 24655834,12543779, 25675182). Approximately 75% of NMC cases feature BRD4-NUT translocation, where the fusion oncogene is expressed under the BRD4 promoter and consists of the first half of the BRD4 protein (which contains all of the functional domain of BRD4) and all of the coding region of NUT. Translocation leading to the fusion protein BRD3-NUT is less common. A novel translocation that results in the fusion protein NSD3-NUT has been observed in NMC of the lung (PMID: 25466466). In a small number of cases involving NUT rearrangements, called NUT variants, the partner of the translocation is unknown. These NUT variants are associated with longer survival, compared with BRD4-NUT carcinomas (PMID: 15483023). NUT rearrangements are found in 18% of cases of undifferentiated carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (PMID: 18391746). Missense mutations and copy number alterations, although rare, are found in some solid cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov. 2015).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":256646,"hugoSymbol":"NUTM1","name":"NUT midline carcinoma family member 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000333756","curatedRefSeq":"XM_011521429.1","geneAliases":["FAM22H","NUT","C15orf55"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24655834","title":"A rare Japanese case with a NUT midline carcinoma in the nasal cavity: a case report with immunohistochemical and genetic analyses.","journal":"Pathology, research and practice","pubDate":"2014 Jun","volume":"210","issue":"6","pages":"383-8","authors":"Suzuki S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.prp.2014.01.013","link":null,"reference":"Suzuki S et al.
