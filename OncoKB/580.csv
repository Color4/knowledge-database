5687,GENE_BACKGROUND,,"The BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1) encodes the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 which forms a stable core complex with BRCA-1 (PMID: 8944023), a tumor suppressor that functions to maintain genome integrity by repairing DNA double-stranded breaks through homologous recombination and cell-cycle checkpoint activation (PMID: 20029420). Poly ADP-ribose (PAR) mediates early recruitment of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex to damaged DNA sites (PMID: 25634209); the BRCA1-BRCT domains of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex are essential for its retention and functionality at these DNA damage sites or the centrosome through binding to regulatory proteins like HP1 and OLA1, respectively (PMID: 23680151). Further, BARD1 independently regulates apoptosis through its direct binding to and stabilization of p53 (PMID 11779501). Three missense mutations which disable BARD1â€™s tumor suppressor function have been observed in breast, ovarian and uterine cancers; C645R is associated with breast and ovarian cancers, V695L is associated with breast cancer and S761N is associated with breast and uterine cancers (PMID 17550235).",,2017-03-29,,580,BARD1,BRCA1 associated RING domain 1,False,ENST00000260947,NM_000465.2,True,8944023,Identification of a RING protein that can interact in vivo with the BRCA1 gene product.,Nature genetics,0001-12-01,14,4,430-40,Wu LC et al,,,0001-12-01,,20029420,BRCA1 and its toolbox for the maintenance of genome integrity.,Nature reviews.
