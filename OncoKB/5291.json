PIK3CB plays a critical role in tumorigenesis driven by loss of PTEN (PMID: 18755892, 18594509) and drives PI3K signaling. Roles other than oncogenic activation of PI3K/AKT pathway have also been described for PIK3CB, including effects on growth and cell metabolism, including insulin signaling (PMID: 18594509, 18780892, 26132308). In HER2-amplified and PIK3CA-mutant cancers, inhibition of PIK3CA can lead to reactivation of PI3K signaling through PIK3CB (PMID: 25544637). Hence, combined inhibition of both isoforms is a promising therapeutic strategy that blocks pathway activation and leads to successful tumor regression (PMID: 25544636, 25544637, 25409150).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5291,"hugoSymbol":"PIK3CB","name":"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit beta","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000289153","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006219.2","geneAliases":["P110BETA","PI3K","PIK3C1","PI3KBETA"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18755892","title":"PTEN-deficient cancers depend on PIK3CB.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2008 Sep 2","volume":"105","issue":"35","pages":"13057-62","authors":"Wee S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.0802655105","link":null,"reference":"Wee S et al.
