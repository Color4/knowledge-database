[{"evidenceId":17672,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"INHBA (inhibin beta A) is a ligand that participates in the formation of activin and inhibin protein complexes that have opposing functions in the gonads and pituitary glands. INHBA can homo- or heterodimerize to regulate follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis (PMID: 27328872). INHBA interacts with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) transmembrane receptors and activates downstream TGF-β signaling (PMID: 25560921). Activin complexes have been associated with regulation of cell differentiation in the ovary, placenta, prostate, and testis (PMID: 9464268, 9207855). Rare somatic mutations in INHBA have been reported (PMID: 18948947) and overexpression of activin has been identified in several cancer types (PMID: 11511564, 9360551, 9714055, 9570994,9543140, 17143484, 9543140, 11994376, 19240652, 19308293). However, there are reports of an anti-tumorigenic effect of the activin signal in many cancers, wherein activin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis mainly through Smad-dependent pathways (PMID: 10869285, 15753386, 16140969, 19493612,22761777), suggesting that INHBA may have context-specific effects on tumor progression.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3624,"hugoSymbol":"INHBA","name":"inhibin beta A subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000242208","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002192.2","geneAliases":["FRP","EDF"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16140969","title":"Activin A mediates growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest through Smads in human breast cancer cells.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2005 Sep 1","volume":"65","issue":"17","pages":"7968-75","authors":"Burdette JE et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Burdette JE et al.
