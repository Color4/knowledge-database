PAK1 is overexpressed in several cancer types, through amplification of the PAK1 gene on chromosome 11q13, a feature most commonly described in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast carcinomas (PMID: 9533029) or through other mechanisms. PAK1 plays several roles in oncogenesis, including increasing cancer proliferation through activation of MAPK signaling (PMID: 7592806), mediation of the oncogenic transformation caused by ErbB2 overexpression (PMID: 23576562), activation of the Wnt pathway (PMID: 21822311), inhibition of apoptosis through activation of BAD (PMID: 15849194, 10611223) and promotion of cancer cell metastasis through direct action on the cytoskeleton (PMID: 21196207).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-10","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5058,"hugoSymbol":"PAK1","name":"p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000356341","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002576.4","geneAliases":["PAKalpha"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15849194","title":"p21-activated Kinase 1 (Pak1)-dependent phosphorylation of Raf-1 regulates its mitochondrial localization, phosphorylation of BAD, and Bcl-2 association.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"2005 Jul 1","volume":"280","issue":"26","pages":"24698-705","authors":"Jin S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Jin S et al.
