[{"evidenceId":18273,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PNRC1 encodes the proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 1, which modulates the transcriptional activation of many nuclear receptors and stimulates transcription by RNA polymerase III through direct binding with its subunit RPC39 (PMID: 7578250, 10894149, 17612402). The proline-rich Src homology domain-3 of PNRC1 binds to the ligand-binding AF2 domain of a variety of nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent and -independent manner. Among these, the nuclear receptors—estrogen receptor α and β, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor and retinoin X receptor—bind PNRC1 in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas the orphan receptors—steroidogenic factor 1 and estrogen-related receptor α 1—interact with PNRC1 in a ligand-independent manner (PMID: 23925889, 17068076, 15604093). In addition to its function as a modulator of transcription, PNRC1 plays an important role in the Ras-MAPK pathway, where it downregulates the signaling cascade through its interaction with Grb2 (PMID: 15122321). All of these functions are exploited in the nucleus of the cell, where PNRC1 is mainly localized—specifically, in the nucleoli (PMID: 20888865). PNRC1 is widely expressed in normal tissue. Downregulation of PNRC1 has been observed in various tumoral tissues, including breast, gastric, hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas; treatment with 5-azacytidine can lead to induction of PNRC mRNA in a time-dependent manner (PMID: 15122321, 11768609). Deletion of PNRC1 has been observed in prostate and pancreatic adenocarcinoma and B-cell lymphoma, whereas copy number alterations have been seen in breast cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov. 2015).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10957,"hugoSymbol":"PNRC1","name":"proline rich nuclear receptor coactivator 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000336032","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006813.2","geneAliases":["PNAS-145","PRR2","B4-2","PROL2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15122321","title":"A novel crosstalk mechanism between nuclear receptor-mediated and growth factor/Ras-mediated pathways through PNRC-Grb2 interaction.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2004 Jul 8","volume":"23","issue":"31","pages":"5394-404","authors":"Zhou D et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Zhou D et al.
