The SMAD proteins have an N-terminal MH1 and a C-terminal MH2 domain, the former important for DNA binding and the latter for binding to regulators and effectors, including the TGFß receptors and transcription cofactors (PMID: 12821112, 25935112). SMAD2 belongs to the subgroup of receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs; SMADs 1,2,3,5 and 8/9) which are phosphorylated twice at a S-S-X-S motif of the MH2 domain in response to the activation of membrane receptor serine kinases by the TGFß superfamily of cytokines (e.g. TGFß1, TGFß2, TGFß3, activin and nodal) (PMID: 25935112, 9759503). This permits formation of a SMAD trimeric complex containing two R-SMADs and SMAD4, cofactor binding and subsequent translocation to the nucleus (PMID: 9759503). Notably, SMAD2 is thought to lack DNA-binding activity itself due to an insertion in the MH1 domain in its most common splice variant (PMID: 16322555, 10708951). The SMAD complex stimulates target gene expression in a cell-type dependent manner specified, in part, by the availability of transcriptional co-activators and chromatin accessibility (PMID: 22992590). The contextual nature of TGFß-dependent transcription allows the TGFß pathway to suppress tumorigenesis in premalignant states and promote invasiveness and metastasis during cancer progression (PMID: 22992590, 18662538, 20495575). Although infrequent, SMAD2 mutations are found in colorectal cancer and less frequently in various other cancer types, such as lung and hepatocellular cancer (PMID: 23139211, 22895193, 22810696, 8752209, 8971158, 10490821, 16959974). Loss of SMAD2 expression occurs at a low frequency in colorectal, gastric and ovarian cancer and correlates with poor prognosis (PMID: 25935112, 23139211, 9679244, 8752209, 12967141, 22539990, 12894231). Notably, both elevated and decreased levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 are associated with poor prognosis in gastric, esophageal squamous cell and lung carcinomas (PMID: 21110833, 22539990, 16788944, 25373709).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4087,"hugoSymbol":"SMAD2","name":"SMAD family member 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262160","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001003652.3","geneAliases":["hSMAD2","JV18","MADH2","MADR2","JV18-1","hMAD-2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22895193","title":"Recurrent R-spondin fusions in colon cancer.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2012 Aug 30","volume":"488","issue":"7413","pages":"660-4","authors":"Seshagiri S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature11282","link":null,"reference":"Seshagiri S et al.
