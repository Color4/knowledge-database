[{"evidenceId":19197,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MAPKAP1 gene encodes a protein (also known as SIN1) that is part of the mTORC2 complex, which is involved in cell growth and cytoskeletal organization (PMID: 19339977). MAPKAP1 acts not only as a scaffold protein for mTORC2 complex formation, but also as a key factor in mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 (PMID: 24795562, 16962653, 17043309). In addition, MAPKAP1 is able to bind RAS and suppress its signaling (PMID: 17303383). MAPKAP1 is mutated or amplified at low frequencies in several cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":79109,"hugoSymbol":"MAPKAP1","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase associated protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000265960","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001006617.1","geneAliases":["MIP1","SIN1b","JC310","SIN1g","SIN1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19339977","title":"Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.","journal":"Nature reviews.
