The VHL protein forms a complex with transcription elongation factors C and B. This complex is critical for VHL protein function, as it stabilizes the protein and prevents proteasomal degradation. VHL mutations that disrupt this complex lead to an unstable VHL protein that is aberrantly degraded (PMID: 7660130, 7660122). Under normoxic conditions, VHL also plays a crucial role in the regulation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). HIF binding to the beta-domain of VHL leads to its ubiquitination and degradation (PMID: 10878807). HIFs are responsible for transcription of numerous genes in response to hypoxic conditions, including pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Loss of VHL leads to inappropriate activation of HIF downstream target genes, thus promoting tumorigenesis in normoxic conditions (PMID: 21386872). Functional inactivation of VHL has been reported through bi-allelic loss of the VHL gene in cases of 3p deletion (PMID: 2885753), heterozygous VHL mutations (PMID: 7915601, 21715564) or promoter methylation (PMID: 7937876). VHL loss can cause hereditary and sporadic forms of von Hippel-Lindau disease, which is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, retinal hemangioblastomas, phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PMID: 18676741, 25533676).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7428,"hugoSymbol":"VHL","name":"von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000256474","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000551.3","geneAliases":["HRCA1","pVHL","VHL1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"7915601","title":"Mutations of the VHL tumour suppressor gene in renal carcinoma.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"1994 May","volume":"7","issue":"1","pages":"85-90","authors":"Gnarra JR et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Gnarra JR et al.
