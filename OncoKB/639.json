PRDM1 was initially described as a transcriptional repressor of interferon ß, and as an essential component of B cell differentiation, wherein it represses MYC (PMID: 1851123, 9887105, 8168136, 9110979. It has been shown to function by interaction with the Groucho family of transcriptional co-repressors as well histone-modifying factors (PMID: 9887105, 14985713, 19124609). More recent results from animal studies indicate PRDM1 as an important factor in establishment in the germ cell lineage, T cell differentiation and homeostasis and heart function (PMID: 15937476, 16565720, 24821700). Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located intergenic to PRDM1 and ATG5 have been associated with increased risk for radiation therapy–induced second malignant neoplasms after radiotherapy for pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma (PMID: 21785431).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-13","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":639,"hugoSymbol":"PRDM1","name":"PR domain 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000369096","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001198.3","geneAliases":["PRDI-BF1","BLIMP1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9110979","title":"Repression of c-myc transcription by Blimp-1, an inducer of terminal B cell differentiation.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"1997 Apr 25","volume":"276","issue":"5312","pages":"596-9","authors":"Lin Y et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lin Y et al.
