[{"evidenceId":19061,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PRSS1 encodes cationic trypsinogen which is secreted in the pancreas, making up about two-thirds of the trypsin content in normal pancreatic juice. Cationic trypsinogen is typically activated in the small intestine to become the digestive enzyme trypsin-1. Trypsin-1 cleaves peptide linkages involving the carboxyl group of lysine or arginine (PMID: 16791840, 7845208, 25010489). It is part of a family of serine protease enzymes that perform a wide variety of functions including immune response, digestion, blood coagulation and reproduction (PMID 12475199). Germline mutations in PRSS1 are associated with premature activation of trypsin-1 causing pancreatic self-digestion that results in pancreatitis and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (PMID: 23187834, 25479140). Missense mutations in PRSS1 are relatively common in some other solid tumors, including melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5644,"hugoSymbol":"PRSS1","name":"protease, serine 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000311737","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002769.4","geneAliases":["TRY1","TRP1","TRYP1","TRY4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16791840","title":"Mutations of human cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) and chronic pancreatitis.","journal":"Human mutation","pubDate":"2006 Aug","volume":"27","issue":"8","pages":"721-30","authors":"Teich N et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Teich N et al.
