The BRCA1-A complex recognizes lysine-63 ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA double strand break (DBS) sites, facilitating damage-dependent BRCA1 localization and DNA repair (PMID: 19261748). The BRISC complex cleaves lysine 63 ubiquitinated substrates, playing a role in interferon responses and proper mitotic spindle assembly (PMID: 24075985, 26195665). Both BRCA1-A and BRISC complexes have deubiquitinase activity. BABAM1 is typically altered by amplification, particularly in neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors, breast and ovarian cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016). Germline variants of BABAM1 have been reported to confer susceptibility to ovarian cancer (PMID: 20852633).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":29086,"hugoSymbol":"BABAM1","name":"BRISC and BRCA1 A complex member 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000359435","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001033549.1","geneAliases":["NBA1","C19orf62","MERIT40","HSPC142"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20852633","title":"Common variants at 19p13 are associated with susceptibility to ovarian cancer.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2010 Oct","volume":"42","issue":"10","pages":"880-4","authors":"Bolton KL et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.666","link":null,"reference":"Bolton KL et al.
