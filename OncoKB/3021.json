This feature, which is unique to the H3.3 histone, is attributable to the presence of three unique amino acids, which favor the ability of H3.3 to destabilize nucleosomes in transcriptionally active regions (PMID: 19633671,15776021). Studies in H3F3B knockout mice have shown that H3.3 plays a significant role in the regulation of chromatin, which is important for genome integrity and cell cycle progression (PMID: 23570311). Somatic mutations in H3F3B are seen in approximately 95% of chondroblastomas, with the most common alteration being K36M, which is expected to inhibit methylation at that site (PMID: 26457357, 24162739). In addition, a novel variant in the 3' UTR of the H3F3B gene has been identified in ovarian cancer (PMID:15870878).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-20","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3021,"hugoSymbol":"H3F3B","name":"H3 histone, family 3B (H3.3B)","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000254810","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005324.3","geneAliases":["H3.3B"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15870878","title":"Identification of novel variant, 1484delG in the 3'UTR of H3F3B, a member of the histone 3B replacement family, in ovarian tumors.","journal":"International journal of oncology","pubDate":"2005 Jun","volume":"26","issue":"6","pages":"1621-7","authors":"Presneau N et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Presneau N et al.
