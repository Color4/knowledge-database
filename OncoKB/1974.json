EIF4A2 is one of three mammalian isoforms of EIF4A (EIF4A1-3) which are mRNA-dependent ATPases and RNA helicases and members of the DEAD-box family of proteins, a group of protein named after one its shared motifs with roles in various processes apart from translation (PMID: 10872469, 2563148). More specifically, EIF4A2 is an essential factor in the binding of mRNA to the 43S pre-initiation complex—a rate-limiting step and main target of translational control—in which EIF4A2 unwinds mRNA secondary structure to enable the ribosome to bind to a single-stranded molecule (PMID: 10872469). EIF4A2 and EIF4A1 are highly similar in sequence and function but appear to be expressed in spatiotemporally distinct patterns (PMID: 3046931, 8521730). A recent study also implicates EIF4A2 in micro-RNA-mediated gene regulation (PMID: 23559250). Downregulation of EIF4A2 expression has been observed in non-small cell lung cancer and correlates with poor prognosis ( but mutations in EIF4A2 are rare in human tumors (PMID: 23867391).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1974,"hugoSymbol":"EIF4A2","name":"eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000323963","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001967.3","geneAliases":["EIF4A","eIF4A-II","DDX2B","EIF4F","eIF-4A-II","BM-010"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"3046931","title":"The mouse protein synthesis initiation factor 4A gene family includes two related functional genes which are differentially expressed.","journal":"The EMBO journal","pubDate":"1988 Jul","volume":"7","issue":"7","pages":"2097-105","authors":"Nielsen PJ et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Nielsen PJ et al.
