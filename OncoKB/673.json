[{"evidenceId":531,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The BRAF protein is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (PMID: 15520807), which under physiologic conditions regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular functions, including proliferation (PMID: 24202393). Genetic alterations in BRAF are found primarily in melanomas and thyroid cancers as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to constitutive BRAF activation, as BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer independently of RAS or upstream activation (PMID: 20179705). Other BRAF mutations have been found that affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582, 12068308). The product of these alterations is a BRAF kinase that can activate MAPK signaling in an unregulated manner and, in some instances, is directly responsible for cancer growth (PMID: 15520807).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-24","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":673,"hugoSymbol":"BRAF","name":"B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000288602","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004333.4","geneAliases":["NS7","B-raf","BRAF1","RAFB1","B-RAF1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"16858395","title":"The amino-terminal B-Raf-specific region mediates calcium-dependent homo- and hetero-dimerization of Raf.","journal":"The EMBO journal","pubDate":"2006 Aug 9","volume":"25","issue":"15","pages":"3556-64","authors":"Terai K et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Terai K et al.
