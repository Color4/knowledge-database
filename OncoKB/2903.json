[{"evidenceId":19696,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The GRIN2A gene encodes the GluN2A protein, a regulatory subunit of the glutamate-gated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) (PMID: 18655795, 20716669). NMDARs are best known for their roles in the brain, but have attracted attention for their potential contribution in cancer due to the effects on cell death, survival and migration (PMID: 23540692, 22291485). Excessive NMDAR activation overloads the cell with calcium and leads to cell death (PMID: 20229265). However, normal NMDAR activity promotes cell survival through the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways (PMID: 11902114). Recent studies show a high prevalence of somatic mutations in GRIN2A in malignant melanoma (PMID: 21499247, 22197930). Whole-exome sequencing of 14 matched normal and metastatic tumor DNAs from untreated individuals with melanoma revealed that GRIN2A was somatically mutated in ∼25% of the melanoma cases (PMID: 21499247). The mutations were distributed throughout the gene, with clustering of mutations at amino acids within important functional domains (e.g., the ligand binding domain), three recurrent alterations at S278F, E371K, and E1175K as well as five nonsense mutations (PMID: 21499247). An independent study also found two additional somatic mutations in GRIN2A, in a whole-exome screen of eight melanoma samples, suggesting that genetic alteration of this gene is important (PMID:22197930). In a more recent study cell lines derived from 4 of 19 (21%) patients with metastatic melanoma carried five missense mutations in GRIN2A. They occurred in three of the four evolutionarily conserved domains of the GluN2A subunit of the NMDAR: the N-terminal, glutamate-binding, and C-terminal domains. All missense mutations were found in treatment-naïve samples. The S349F, G762E, and P1132L substitutions were predicted by SIFT to disrupt protein function. Patients whose tumors carried non-synonymous mutations in GRIN2A had faster disease progression and shorter overall survival (PMID:24455489). Gene expression profiles generated on CSC-like cells derived from human ovarian carcinoma showed GRIN2A significantly upregulated (9.36-fold) compared with parental cancer cells (PMID: 25715123). Moreover, GRIN2A is a frequently overexpressed gene in ALK-positive lung cancer (PMID: 22080568). GRIN2A promoter is methylated in human colorectal carcinoma (PMID:17922030). Finally, there is evidence of amplification and more rarely translocation of GRIN2A in a subset of TCC-UB (transitional cell carcinoma arising in the urinary bladder), representing a potential therapeutic target (PMID: 24468268).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2903,"hugoSymbol":"GRIN2A","name":"glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000330684","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001134407.1","geneAliases":["FESD","EPND","LKS","NR2A","GluN2A","NMDAR2A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22197930","title":"Frequent somatic mutations in MAP3K5 and MAP3K9 in metastatic melanoma identified by exome sequencing.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2011 Dec 25","volume":"44","issue":"2","pages":"165-9","authors":"Stark MS et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.1041","link":null,"reference":"Stark MS et al.
