[{"evidenceId":18895,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RPTOR (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) encodes a scaffolding protein that regulates the assembly, localization and substrate binding of mTORC1. mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is an atypical serine-threonine protein kinase that belongs to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family (PMID: 19339977). It interacts with several proteins to form two distinct complexes named mTOR complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2). RPTOR/raptor is a unique member of the mTRORC1 complex and serves as a scaffolding protein and is essential for mTORC1 complex activity (PMID: 25450580, 14684181, 26159692). mTORC1 is a key regulator of protein synthesis (PMID: 19339977). RPTOR binds to the translational regulator 4E-BP1 and mTORC1 then directly phosphorylates 4E-BP1, which, in turn, promotes protein synthesis (PMID: 19339977, 15718470). mTORC1 also controls the synthesis of lipids required for proliferating cells to generate membranes (PMID: 19948145). The mTOR pathway is of great importance in cancer pathogenesis (PMID: 25450580). Many components of the pathway upstream of mTORC1 are mutated in human cancers (PMID: 22500797). Derivatives of rapamycin (rapalogs) that potently inhibit mTOR activity are tested in different cancer types some of which are clinically approved (PMID: 21490404).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":57521,"hugoSymbol":"RPTOR","name":"regulatory associated protein of MTOR complex 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000306801","curatedRefSeq":"NM_020761.2","geneAliases":["Mip1","KOG1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19339977","title":"Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.","journal":"Nature reviews.
