It is involved in recognizing the oxidative damage DNA product 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, particularly when mis-paired with adenine (PMID:1495996). MUTY with 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) DNA glycosylase repairs these DNA lesions to prevent GC to TA transversions (PMID:17581577). Germline mutations leads to colorectal polyposis and adenomas that are inherited in a recessive fashion and an increased risk of gliomas and breast cancer (PMID:12606733, 26902849, 26824983, 26296701).
