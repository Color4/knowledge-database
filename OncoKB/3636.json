[{"evidenceId":19617,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The INPPL1 gene encodes SHIP2 phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate (PIP3) to its diphosphate counterpart (PIP2), thus negatively regulating PI3K pathway signaling (PMID: 10761925). INPPL1 also plays a role in insulin signaling, EGFR turnover and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (PMID: 9660833, 11349134, 11739414). INPPL1 promotes cell proliferation in vitro, and its overexpression correlates with invasive features in breast cancer (PMID: 19065064, 19082482) and other cancers. INPPL1 is mainly altered by amplification, particularly in breast tumors, but also in esophagus and head and neck cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3636,"hugoSymbol":"INPPL1","name":"inositol polyphosphate phosphatase like 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000298229","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001567.3","geneAliases":["SHIP2","OPSMD"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"10761925","title":"PIP2 and PIP3: complex roles at the cell surface.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"2000 Mar 17","volume":"100","issue":"6","pages":"603-6","authors":"Czech MP","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Czech MP.
