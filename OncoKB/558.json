Signaling through AXL mediates proliferation, survival and chemoresistance in AXL-expressing cells (PMID: 23982172). This paracrine signaling axis regulates such diverse cellular functions through activation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (PMID: 18620092). Additionally, AXL has been shown to be essential to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, thereby regulating breast cancer metastasis (PMID: 16585512). AXL is overexpressed in many human cancers including lung, breast and pancreatic cancer, and is a chronic myelogeneous leukemia-associated oncogene (PMID: 1656220). Currently, inhibitors specifically targeting AXL or multi-targeted kinase inhibitors with good potency against AXL are under clinical development (PMCID: PMC4259419).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":558,"hugoSymbol":"AXL","name":"AXL receptor tyrosine kinase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000301178","curatedRefSeq":"NM_021913.4","geneAliases":["ARK","JTK11","Tyro7","UFO"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18620092","title":"TAM receptor tyrosine kinases: biologic functions, signaling, and potential therapeutic targeting in human cancer.","journal":"Advances in cancer research","pubDate":"2008","volume":"100","issue":"","pages":"35-83","authors":"Linger RM et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/S0065-230X(08)00002-X","link":null,"reference":"Linger RM et al.
