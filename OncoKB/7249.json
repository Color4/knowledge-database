TSC2 is, along with TSC1 (hamartin), one of the two causative genes in tuberous sclerosis, a disorder characterized by the presence of hamartomas or multiple benign and sometimes malignant growths (PMID: 23485365, 10205261). TSC2 protein has a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity and inhibits RHEB at the lysosomal membrane in an insulin- and nutrient-dependent manner (PMID: 22795129, 24529379, 24714658). TSC2 acts in combination with TSC1, which serves as a molecular scaffold for TSC2 itself and TBC1D7, forming the heteromeric TSC complex. TSC2-mediated inactivation of RHEB, causes inactivation of the mTORC1 complex (PMID: 22795129, 24529379, 24714658).The TSC complex associates with RHEB at the lysosomal membrane and is thought to be the main regulator of RHEB (PMID: 24863881, 24529379, 14614311). Both TSC1 and TSC2 are also phosphorylated by several kinases (e.g., AKT, RSK1, ERK, AMPK, and GSK3) thus integrating multiple pathways before providing regulatory inhibition to the mTOR pathway (PMID: 16959574). Due to the central role of the mTOR pathway in cellular growth and regulation of protein synthesis, TSC2 inactivating mutations, which result in a constitutively active mTORC1 complex, have been theorized to result in cancer \"addiction\" to the mTOR pathway, thus indicating sensitivity to mTOR-inhibiting agents such as everolimus or temsirolimus (PMID: 22923433). In fact, mutation in any of the TSC complex members results in inability to regulate RHEB through loss of TSC2 GAP activity, dissociation of the TSC complex, or inability to localize the TSC complex to the lysosomal membrane (PMID: 24529379). Given the role of mTORC1 in the regulation of autophagy, it has been proposed that the metabolic derrangements that occur in TSC2-null tumors may result in reliance on autophagy for cellular metabolism, opening mTOR-independent therapeutic strategies that need to be further explored (PMID: 24296756, 25298408). TSC2 mutations, which are often truncating or splice site mutations, frequently occur in human cancers, including liver, endometrial, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, bladder, stomach, renal clear cell carcinoma, and others (ranging from 1% to 5%, cBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2015).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7249,"hugoSymbol":"TSC2","name":"tuberous sclerosis 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000219476","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000548.3","geneAliases":["PPP1R160","TSC4","LAM"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22923433","title":"Genome sequencing identifies a basis for everolimus sensitivity.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2012 Oct 12","volume":"338","issue":"6104","pages":"221","authors":"Iyer G et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1126/science.1226344","link":null,"reference":"Iyer G et al.
