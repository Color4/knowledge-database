[{"evidenceId":19019,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RAD51 is a member of the family of RAD51 proteins which function in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). RAD51 polymerizes onto DNA creating RAD51-single-stranded (ss)DNA filaments. Once localized, RAD51 probes for homologous DNA and initiates the process of strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA (PMID: 19122145, 20930833). RAD51 complexes with known tumor suppressors including BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2; specifically, BRCA2 loads RAD51 monomers at sites of DNA double-strand break (PMID: 14636569, 20729832, 20930833, 20871615, 20729858). Evidence suggests that some germline RAD51 variants may increase breast cancer risk in certain populations (PMID: 10807537, 26108708), while other studies suggest the RAD51 135 G/C single nucleotide polymorphism may increase breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers (PMID: 11248061, 17999359). RAD51 is infrequently mutated in cancer; however, RAD51 overexpression has been linked to increased oncogenic potential in several tumor types, including pancreatic and breast (PMID: 18243065, 24811120, 26317153, 21807066, 10851081).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5888,"hugoSymbol":"RAD51","name":"RAD51 recombinase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000267868","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002875.4","geneAliases":["RAD51A","HRAD51","MRMV2","RECA","HsRad51","FANCR","HsT16930","BRCC5"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26317153","title":"High levels of RAD51 perturb DNA replication elongation and cause unscheduled origin firing due to impaired CHK1 activation.","journal":"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","pubDate":"2015","volume":"14","issue":"19","pages":"3190-202","authors":"Parplys AC et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1080/15384101.2015.1055996","link":null,"reference":"Parplys AC et al.
