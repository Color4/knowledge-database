CIC was identified in a screen for mutations affecting the anterior-posterior pattern of Drosophila embryos (PMID: 10652276). CIC expression is detected in several normal tissues including the brain, lung, mammary tissue, thymus and lymph nodes (PMID: 12393275). CIC exists in a large protein complex with ATXN1, which directly binds CIC and modulates its transcriptional repressor activity (PMID: 17190598). In Drosophila, CIC is a downstream component of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways that include EGFR, Torso and RAS/RAF/MAPK and acts as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of RTK signaling (PMID: 11714680, 11861482). CIC is frequently mutated in oligodendrogliomas with 1p/19q deletions and is likely to be one of the tumor suppressors on chromosome 19q (PMID: 21817013, 22869205, 22588899). To a lesser extent, CIC is mutated in several other cancers including stomach, colorectal, breast, uterine and pancreas (cBioPortal, MSKCC, April 2015; PMID: 25079317). In addition to mutations, chromosomal translocations that produce chimeric CIC proteins fused to either DUX4 or FOXO4 are reported in EWSR1-negative, highly aggressive round cell sarcomas (PMID: 19837261, 25007147).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-25","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":23152,"hugoSymbol":"CIC","name":"capicua transcriptional repressor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000575354","curatedRefSeq":"NM_015125.3","geneAliases":[],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"17190598","title":"ATAXIN-1 interacts with the repressor Capicua in its native complex to cause SCA1 neuropathology.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"2006 Dec 29","volume":"127","issue":"7","pages":"1335-47","authors":"Lam YC et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Lam YC et al.
