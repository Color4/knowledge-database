The BCL2 family is defined by the presence of Bcl2 homology (BH) domains. MCL1, similar to BCL2, confers cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis. Together with BCL2, MCL1 regulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and activation of caspases (PMID: 21763611, 20683470). Genome-wide studies have identified increased gene copy numbers of MCL1 across many cancer entities (PMID: 20164920). Focal amplifications of MCL1 were found in over 10% of cancers and were even higher in lung and breast cancers (PMID: 20164920). MCL1 expression can drive lymphomagenesis (PMID: 9787159) and is required for lung adenocarcinoma formation (PMID: 21406400). Through inhibition of apoptosis, MCL1 leads to increased survival of cancer cells and resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli (PMID: 23478333). Therapies targeting MCL1 and other BCL2 family members are being developed and are currently under investigation (PMID: 26045609).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4170,"hugoSymbol":"MCL1","name":"BCL2 family apoptosis regulator","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000369026","curatedRefSeq":"NM_021960.4","geneAliases":["Mcl-1","bcl2-L-3","MCL1S","EAT","TM","mcl1/EAT","MCL1-ES","BCL2L3","MCL1L"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18955968","title":"Bcl-2 family proteins and cancer.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2008 Oct 27","volume":"27","issue":"50","pages":"6398-406","authors":"Yip KW et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.307","link":null,"reference":"Yip KW et al.
