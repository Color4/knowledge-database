[{"evidenceId":11349,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MAP2K1 (MEK1) protein is a serine/threonine kinase that signals downstream of RAF and activates ERK1/2, thus playing a critical regulatory role in the MAP-Kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK cascade is involved in diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. Deregulation of this pathway by genetic alteration of its components RAS and RAF have been found in several different cancer types (PMID: 12068308, 12509763). Deregulation of MEK1 activity specifically occurs as a consequence of RAS or RAF mutations. Mutations of MEK1 are rare and occur in a subset of tumor types that frequently harbor BRAF or RAS mutations, including melanoma, colorectal and lung cancers (PMID: 22753777). Some MEK1 mutations may confer resistance to both MEK and RAF inhibitors and can arise as a resistance mechanism to RAF inhibition (PMID: 19915144, 21383288).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5604,"hugoSymbol":"MAP2K1","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000307102","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002755.3","geneAliases":["MKK1","PRKMK1","MEK1","MAPKK1","CFC3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12068308","title":"Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2002 Jun 27","volume":"417","issue":"6892","pages":"949-54","authors":"Davies H et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Davies H et al.
