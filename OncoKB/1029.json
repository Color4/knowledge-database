The two distinct proteins are tumor suppressors, yet alterations in the p16(Ink4a) protein are more commonly oncogenic (PMID: 19260062). p16(Ink4a) binds to CDK4 and CDK6, inhibiting these CDKs from binding D-type Cyclins and phosphorylating the retinoblastoma (RB) protein (PMID: 15878778, 8259215, 9751050). These interactions lead to G1 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence, which can serve as a cellular defense mechanism (PMID: 22025288). CDKN2A also encodes for is p14(ARF), which blocks the oncogenic activity of MDM2 by inhibiting MDM2-induced degradation of p53. Thus p14(ARF) enhances p53 dependent transactivation and apoptosis (PMID: 9529249). Deletion of CDKN2A in murine models results in the generation of spontaneous tumors, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 8620534). CDKN2A is frequently mutated or deleted in a variety of tumors, and lack or impaired function of CDKN2A may result in deregulated cellular proliferation (PMID: 24136988, 15878778). CDKN2A alteration (by loss or mutation) allows for activation of CDK4 and CDK6 and phosphorylation of RB, leading to cell cycle progression beyond the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Inhibitors that target CDK proteins, specifically CDK4/6 inhibit the ability of cells to progress through the cell cycle unchecked.
