[{"evidenceId":19121,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90 kDa, polypeptide 4 (RPS6KA4, also known as MSK2 or RSK-B), is a serine/threonine protein kinase, composed of two kinase domains, the N and C-terminal kinase domains and acts as an important downstream effector of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PMID:9003374,7498520). Many growth factors, peptide hormones, and neurotransmitters regulate RPS6KA4 through Erk1/2 signaling (PMID: 10411321,10610536). Knockdown of RPS6KA4 gene expression leads to upregulation of p53 transcriptional activity and its overexpression results in the inhibition of p53 target promoters and p53-mediated apoptosis, indicating that RPS6KA4 has a p53-inhibiting function (PMID:16929179, 19797274). Moreover, the antitumoral effect of α-Lipoic acid (α-LA) on colorectal cancer cells stems, at least partially, from its property to prevent RPS6KA4-mediated p53 inhibition (PMID:23599020). MAPKs play a major role in UV-induced skin cancer development and a phospho-MAPK array analysis indicated that p38α and its downstream target proteins, MSK2 and HSP27, were strongly activated by UVB and SUV (PMID:23382047). RPS6KA4 is also known as MSK2 (human mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 2) and shares 64% homology with MSK1. Activated MSK1/2 is known to induce cellular transformation in various cell lines; for instance, following induction by EGF and TPA, MSK1/2 activation leads to cellular transformation of mouse epidermal cells (JB6 cells) (PMID:18381464). The role of MSK1/2 in cellular transformation also involves its ability to activate various transcription factors such as CREB, ATF1, ER81, and the p65 subunit of NFκB, which in turn activate the transcription of genes involved in tumorigenic and metastatic progression (PMID:22983151). MSK1/2 also mediate chromatin remodeling that is required at the enhancer and upstream promoter element for TPA-induced initiation of TFF1 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer epithelial cells (PMID:23675462). Finally, an exciting new study reported that MSK1/2 is involved in an in vivo model of skin tumor development (PMID: 21314333). Mice lacking MSK1 and 2 exhibit reduced skin tumor formation by tumor promoting agents 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and TPA in a multistage skin carcinogenesis model compared to wild-type mice. As such, MSK1/2 as a key regulator of expression of several oncogenes presents a potential target in chemotherapeutic development (PMID:21314333). Inhibition of MSK1/2 can be achieved by cell permeable molecules that have varying degrees of potency and selectivity. The two most common inhibitors used to study the effects of MSK in vitro are H89 and Ro 318220 (PMID:10998351,22983151).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8986,"hugoSymbol":"RPS6KA4","name":"ribosomal protein S6 kinase A4","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000334205","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003942.2","geneAliases":["RSK-B","S6K-alpha-4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23382047","title":"Sunlight UV-induced skin cancer relies upon activation of the p38α signaling pathway.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2013 Apr 1","volume":"73","issue":"7","pages":"2181-8","authors":"Liu K et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3408","link":null,"reference":"Liu K et al.
