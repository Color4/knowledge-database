The gene was first identified in as the oncogene v-mpl, from the murine myeloproliferative leukemia virus that transformed hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow in mice (PMID: 7836743). The normal receptor protein is critical in growth and regulation of megakaryocytes and platelet production (PMID: 8202154). The gene is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular cytokine binding domain and intracellular cytokine signaling domains. Binding of its ligand, thrombopoietin (TPO), results in receptor dimerization and activation of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases; this leads to activation of the STAT family of transcription factors (PMID: 7796811). The MAPK pathway can also be activated as a result of receptor activation (PMID: 10438715). The most common mutations, W515L and W515K, which activate receptor signaling are found in myeloproliferative neoplasms such as essential thrombocytosis and myelofibrosis (PMID: 16834459). Aberrant expression of MPL has been reported in some solid tumors. In a study of 128 colorectal cancer cases, higher MPL expression was associated with metastasis to liver and lung (PMID:23747337). However, in a study of 118 breast tumors and 29 lung tumors, MPL mRNA was either not detectable or at very low levels (PMID: 22967017). The thromobopoietin receptor can be activated by administration of drug agonists such as eltrombopag and romiplostim. These therapies have been approved for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (PMID:18046028,7050891).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4352,"hugoSymbol":"MPL","name":"MPL proto-oncogene, thrombopoietin receptor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000372470","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005373.2","geneAliases":["CD110","THCYT2","TPOR","MPLV","C-MPL"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"7050891","title":"[2 cases of congenital toxoplasmosis].","journal":"La Pediatria","pubDate":"1982 Mar 31","volume":"90","issue":"1","pages":"69-86","authors":"D'Avanzo M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"D'Avanzo M et al.
