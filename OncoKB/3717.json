[{"evidenceId":9144,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) gene encodes one of four members of the JAK family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (PMID: 25057888). JAK2 is ubiquitously expressed and located on the intracellular side of the plasma membrane, connected to extracellular cytokine receptors (PMID: 1848670). Upon binding of an extracellular ligand to the cytokine receptor, JAK2 forms homodimers leading to activating transphosphorylation. This recruits and phosphorylates downstream effectors such as STAT3 and STAT5, enabling them to translocate into the nucleus and act as transcription factors (PMID: 25057888). JAK2 signaling is necessary for normal production of blood cells such as erythrocytes and thrombocytes (PMID: 9590173). JAK2 V617F, leading to overactive JAK2 signaling, is a driving mutation found in a majority of cases of the myeloproliferative neoplasms polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis (PMID: 23009934, 25629741).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3717,"hugoSymbol":"JAK2","name":"Janus kinase 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000381652","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004972.3","geneAliases":["THCYT3","JTK10"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9590173","title":"Jak2 is essential for signaling through a variety of cytokine receptors.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"1998 May 1","volume":"93","issue":"3","pages":"385-95","authors":"Parganas E et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Parganas E et al.
