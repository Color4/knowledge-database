Following activation, YES1 phosphorylates various substrates, including CDK4 (to control cell cycle progression) and PAR3 (to regulate cell-cell adhesion) (PMID: 18479465, 17053785). Additionally, YES1 stimulates chemokine-directed T cell migration by phosphorylating collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), promotes cell migration through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in hepatocytes through its participation in the CD95L signaling pathway (PMID: 19276087, 21713032, 15917250). YES1 plays a central role in malignant mesothelioma cell growth (PMID: 22948717) and has been shown to act as an oncogene in several tumor models, including colorectal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma, through increased expression and kinase activity (PMID: 7690925, 9816313, 17007035, 7690926). YES1 is amplified in basal-like breast cancer and esophageal squamous carcinoma (PMID: 21779430, 11756219). In colorectal carcinoma, increased YES1 activation correlates with poor prognosis, as YES1 activity is elevated in adenomas with the highest malignant risk (PMID: 7806032).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7525,"hugoSymbol":"YES1","name":"YES proto-oncogene 1, Src family tyrosine kinase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000314574","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005433.3","geneAliases":["HsT441","c-yes","P61-YES","Yes"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12496267","title":"Cholecystokinin stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, Yes, and protein kinase C.
