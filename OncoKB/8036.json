[{"evidenceId":18150,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The SHOC2 gene encodes a positive regulator of the Ras-MAPK pathway. SHOC2 forms a complex with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) and enhances growth factor- and Ras-mediated MAPK pathway activation, whereas it has no effect on Raf- and MEK-induced mechanisms (PMID: 10783161, 16630891). Mechanistically, under M-ras activation, SHOC2 facilitates PP1c-mediated dephosphorylation of the Raf-1 Ser-259 inhibitory site (PMID: 16630891). SHOC2 overexpression induces proliferation and tumorigenic growth in EGF-mediated and Ras-mutant cancer cells (PMID: 25514808, 24211266). Genetic alterations of SHOC2 are rarely seen in tumors. Germline mutations at specific SHOC2 sites are causal variants of neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous disorders such as Noonan-like syndrome and other RASopathies (PMID: 19684605, 23918763, 25137548).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-29","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8036,"hugoSymbol":"SHOC2","name":"SHOC2, leucine rich repeat scaffold protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000369452","curatedRefSeq":"NM_007373.3","geneAliases":["SIAA0862","SOC2","SUR8"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25514808","title":"Shoc2/Sur8 protein regulates neurite outgrowth.","journal":"PloS one","pubDate":"2014","volume":"9","issue":"12","pages":"e114837","authors":"Leon G et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0114837","link":null,"reference":"Leon G et al.
