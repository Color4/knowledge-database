It is thus important in regulating various downstream activities in the cell, such as growth, proliferation and motility. Upon RTK activation, PIK3R3 helps recruit the PI3K enzymatic complex to the cell membrane and allows the PI3K catalytic subunit to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is important in activating downstream signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR (PMID:12040186). PIK3R3 has been shown to directly modulate IGF2 signaling in glioblastoma and is amplified in some cases (PMID: 17360667, 16530701).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8503,"hugoSymbol":"PIK3R3","name":"phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000262741","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003629.3","geneAliases":["p55-GAMMA","p55PIK","p55"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"16530701","title":"Molecular subclasses of high-grade glioma predict prognosis, delineate a pattern of disease progression, and resemble stages in neurogenesis.","journal":"Cancer cell","pubDate":"2006 Mar","volume":"9","issue":"3","pages":"157-73","authors":"Phillips HS et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Phillips HS et al.
