Hereditary variants in ERCC5 have been implicated in several disorders with defective DNA repair including xeroderma pigmentosum, Cocayne's syndrome, cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome, and arthrogryposis (PMID: 24700531, 8317483, 2478446). Somatic ERCC5 mutations have not yet been determined to be driver mutations in cancer although aberrant expression has been detected in breast and ovarian cancer (PMID: 18565881, 19289372).
