[{"evidenceId":15381,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The NF1 gene encodes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPases HRAS, KRAS and NRAS (PMID: 2121370,1946382). When bound to RAS, the NF1 protein stabilizes the GTPase activity of the RAS proteins, which switches RAS from its active, GTP-bound state to its inactive, GDP-bound state (PMID: 9219684, 9302992). The GAP-related domain (GRD) is the catalytic domain of NF1, which is directly responsible for its GAP activity but only encompasses approximately 10% of the protein. NF1 is congenitally altered in the cancer-predisposing syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and is somatically altered in many tumor types including breast cancer, melanoma, and glioma (PMID: 2134734, 1946382, 18772890, 23000897, 9639526, 18948947, 22817889). Inactivation of NF1 due to gene deletion, gene mutation, or protein degradation results in elevated levels of active, GTP-bound RAS and activation of downstream pathways such as the MAPK/ERK pathway and the PI3K pathway (PMID: 19573811, 24576830, 8563751, 7542586, 8052307, 12509763). Missense and truncating mutations occur across the entire gene and do not localize to hotspots. Alterations occurring on one allele of NF1 likely lead to haploinsufficiency of the protein (PMID: 7920653,18089636) as many patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 have an unaltered second allele despite exhibiting symptoms of the syndrome. Additionally, functional loss of heterozygosity likely occurs on the second NF1 allele, as tumors with NF1 point mutations have lower levels of mRNA than wildtype tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, May 2015).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-27","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4763,"hugoSymbol":"NF1","name":"neurofibromin 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000358273","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001042492.2","geneAliases":["WSS","NFNS","VRNF"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"8563751","title":"Loss of NF1 results in activation of the Ras signaling pathway and leads to aberrant growth in haematopoietic cells.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"1996 Feb","volume":"12","issue":"2","pages":"144-8","authors":"Bollag G et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Bollag G et al.
