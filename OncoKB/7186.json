[{"evidenceId":18975,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"TRAF2 encodes for TNF receptor associated factor 2 that interacts with and transduces signals from the Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor to activate the NF-kappa B pathway and Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) (PMID:8565075, 8985011, 8898208). It also mediates signaling from CD40 in immune cells (PMID:7544915, 15539150). Through its RING domain it has ubiquitin ligase activity (PMID: 23142077, 20577214). TRAF2 regulates lymphocyte proliferation and survival and the immune response (PMID:9390693, 9390694, 11435475). It also has a role in hematopoietic stem cells by mediating activation of the MAPK pathway (PMID:25824820). In tumor cells TRAF2 is involved in NF-kappa B activation leading to tumor cell survival and resistance to targeted therapy (PMID: 25843712,19336568, 22589389). Mutations have been found in multiple myeloma, lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas (PMID:17692805, 24362935,19412164, 23868181).
