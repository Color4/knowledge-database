ATRX is a member of the SWI1/SNF2 family of helicase/adenosine triphosphatases (ATPase) that are involved in chromatin remodeling (PMID: 20110566, 17609377). Structurally, ATRX consists of a C-terminal helicase/ATPase domain and an N-terminal ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain that is a PHD-like zinc finger (PMID: 17609377). The ADD domain is involved in chromatin binding and DNA binding (PMID: 17609377). ATRX is involved in the incorporation of histone H3.3 during telomere replication (PMID: 20110566). Loss of function or loss of ATRX expression is strongly correlated with an alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype in tumors (PMID: 21719641). Mutations in ATRX have been associated with chromosomal instability and therefore play a role in oncogenesis (PMID: 24148618).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":546,"hugoSymbol":"ATRX","name":"ATRX, chromatin remodeler","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000373344","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000489.3","geneAliases":["JMS","MRXHF1","SFM1","MRX52","XH2","ZNF-HX","RAD54","XNP","ATR2","SHS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"8968741","title":"ATRX encodes a novel member of the SNF2 family of proteins: mutations point to a common mechanism underlying the ATR-X syndrome.","journal":"Human molecular genetics","pubDate":"1996 Dec","volume":"5","issue":"12","pages":"1899-907","authors":"Picketts DJ et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Picketts DJ et al.
