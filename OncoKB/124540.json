[{"evidenceId":19142,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"MSI2 encodes the RNA-binding protein Musashi-2, which displays more than 90% homology withMusashi-1 protein at the amino acid level in the RNA-binding domain. Musashi2, like Musashi1, possesses m-Numb mRNA translation repressing activity, and thus activates Notch signaling to maintain self-renewal activity of neural stem cells (PMID: 15925591). In addition, Musashi-2 expression is required for self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells in early stages of differentiation (PMID: 22496868). MSI2 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of primitive origin, namely long-term (LT) HSCs, short-term (ST) HSCs and lymphoid myeloid primed progenitors (LMPP), and is important in regulating the stem cell compartment and proliferation of primitive progenitors downstream of LT-HSCs (PMID: 21613258). Overexpression of MSI2 in mouse models cooperates with the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein to drive aggressive leukemia. MSI2 is over-expressed in human myeloid leukemias, and its expression level directly correlates with survival of patients with the disease (PMID: 20616797, 20639863).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":124540,"hugoSymbol":"MSI2","name":"musashi RNA binding protein 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000284073","curatedRefSeq":"NM_138962.2","geneAliases":["MSI2H"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22496868","title":"Musashi2 is required for the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.","journal":"PloS one","pubDate":"2012","volume":"7","issue":"4","pages":"e34827","authors":"Wuebben EL et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034827","link":null,"reference":"Wuebben EL et al.
