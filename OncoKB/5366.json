[{"evidenceId":18659,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PMAIP1, also known as NOXA, encodes for phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1, a gene involved in regulating apoptosis (PMID:15694340). PMAIP1 contains a Bcl2 homology 3 (BH3) domain that mediates interactions with Bcl-2 family member proteins to alter the balance towards pro-apoptosis (PMID:15901672). Specifically, inhibition of Mcl-1 by PMAIP1 can lead to mitochondrial cytochrome c release and cell death (PMID:17115033). PMAIP1 is induced by TP53 as a consequence of DNA damage and other death signals such as c-Myc induction (PMID:10807576, 18042711, 23948298, 23153536, 19647221). PMAIP1 function is important for sensitivity of tumors to anti-cancer therapy (PMID: 24525728, 24030633, 23302226, 22693249, 17038534). Its expression may also determine the efficacy of BH3 mimetics in development for cancer therapy (PMID:22128299,21628457).
