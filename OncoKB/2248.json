FGFs are classified as intracrine, paracrine, and endocrine FGFs based on their action mechanisms (PMID: 25772309). FGF3 belongs to the FGF7 subfamily which includes FGF3, FGF7, FGF10 and FGF22 (PMID: 26369258). For inner ear, FGF3 has fallen into and out of favor as a potential ear-specific inducer. Excess FGF3 can induce the formation of extra otic vesicles (ear rings), whereas insufficient FGF3 can block their formation in chick (PMID: 10906788, 10769226). FGF3 has been identified as a main target of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) insertional activation in mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 6327073). FGF3 specifically cooperate with WNT1 to induce the development of mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 9205106). Endogenous expression of FGF3 in MCF7 cells increases the tumorigenic potential (PMID: 10845805).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2248,"hugoSymbol":"FGF3","name":"fibroblast growth factor 3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000334134","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005247.2","geneAliases":["INT2","HBGF-3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"10845805","title":"Progression in MCF-7 breast cancer cell tumorigenicity: compared effect of FGF-3 and FGF-4.","journal":"Breast cancer research and treatment","pubDate":"2000 Mar","volume":"60","issue":"1","pages":"15-28","authors":"Hajitou A et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Hajitou A et al.
