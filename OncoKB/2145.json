Compared to its homolog, EZH2, EZH1-containing PRC2 complexes show weaker methylation activity, target fewer genes, and are more abundant in non-proliferative adult organs (PMID: 19026781). EZH1 plays a role in maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency (PMID: 19026780). EZH1 is not commonly altered in cancer, but recurrent mutations in EZH1 are often the second hit in autonomous thyroid adenomas (PMID: 27500488). Dual EZH1/2 inhibitors are being tested preclinically in several cancers (PMID: 24183969, 25395428).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2145,"hugoSymbol":"EZH1","name":"enhancer of zeste 1 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000428826","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001991.3","geneAliases":["KMT6B"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"27500488","title":"Recurrent EZH1 mutations are a second hit in autonomous thyroid adenomas.","journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","pubDate":"2016 Sep 1","volume":"126","issue":"9","pages":"3383-8","authors":"Calebiro D et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1172/JCI84894","link":null,"reference":"Calebiro D et al.
