TGBR2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that heterodimerizes with other receptor-family members upon binding of a ligand belonging to the TGFß family. Following ligand activation, TGFBR2 phosphorylates its dimerization partner and induces phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as the SMAD proteins, which control gene transcription (PMID: 22992590, 18662538). TGFß signaling controls multiple biological processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation and tissue homeostasis and, as such, is implicated in multiple human disorders (PMID: 22992590, 11057902). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in TGFBR2 can cause the autosomal Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 2 and have also been found in individuals with Marfan and similar syndromes (PMID: 15731757, 15235604, 8317497). Mutations associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome were shown in cell lines to inactive the receptor function (PMID: 15235604). TGFBR2 is considered a tumor suppressor and inactivating mutations have been detected in gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers (PMID: 22992590).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7048,"hugoSymbol":"TGFBR2","name":"transforming growth factor beta receptor 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000359013","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001024847.2","geneAliases":["AAT3","LDS1B","LDS2","LDS2B","TGFR-2","RIIC","MFS2","TAAD2","FAA3","TGFbeta-RII"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"15235604","title":"Heterozygous TGFBR2 mutations in Marfan syndrome.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2004 Aug","volume":"36","issue":"8","pages":"855-60","authors":"Mizuguchi T et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Mizuguchi T et al.
