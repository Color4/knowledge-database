[{"evidenceId":5893,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The AURKA gene encodes a cell-cycle regulatory kinase that promotes entry into and proper progression through mitosis. AURKA is expressed in actively proliferating cells, specifically in the G2 and mitotic phases of the cell cycle (PMID: 12884918). AURKA has multiple roles in promoting cell division, including recruitment of microtubule-nucleating proteins to centrosomes to mediate spindle assembly (PMID: 7720077, 16186253) and regulating entry into mitosis (PMID: 18566290). AURKA amplification has been observed in multiple tumor types, including breast, leukemia, bladder, ovarian, gastric, esophageal, liver, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers (PMID: 18820130, 18812553, 12417041, 9606188, 12631597, 15289843, 17390048); amplification usually occurs at a frequency of <10%, with negligible rates of mutation and deletion (cBioportal, MSKCC; June 2015). Overexpression of AURKA can promote cellular transformation (PMID: 9606188) and may potentiate the activity of other oncogenes, such as RAS (PMID: 15592510). Small-molecule inhibitors of AURKA (and the related Aurora B and C kinases) are currently in clinical trials as potential anti-mitotic chemotherapeutic drugs. Currently, these inhibitors are being evaluated therapeutically as general inhibitors of cell proliferation (PMID: 24965505). The utility of Aurora kinase inhibitors specifically in tumors with AURKA amplification has yet to be reported.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6790,"hugoSymbol":"AURKA","name":"aurora kinase A","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000312783","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003600.2","geneAliases":["PPP1R47","AIK","BTAK","STK15","ARK1","STK6","STK7","AURA"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12417041","title":"Differentially regulated genes as putative targets of amplifications at 20q in ovarian cancers.","journal":"Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann","pubDate":"2002 Oct","volume":"93","issue":"10","pages":"1114-22","authors":"Watanabe T et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Watanabe T et al.
