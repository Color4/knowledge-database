As a molecular chaperone, CALR acts to prevent the aggregation and export of partially or incorrectly folded proteins in ER (PMID: 16467570). CALR and its paralog CNX (calnexin) are both important to ensure the quality of glycoproteins, including membrane-bound proteins, transporters, and certain secreted factors (PMID: 10567207). Additionally, CALR has been implicated in other cellular functions and is found in the cell nucleus and has ability to inhibit function of nuclear hormone receptors, for example the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (PMID: 8107808 , 8107809, 7556879, 9013706, 7667104). Recurrent mutations in CALR were identified in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms which did not have mutations in JAK2 or MPL (PMID: 24325356, 24325359, 25873496). Specifically, the majority of patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis, which lacked JAK2 or MPL mutation, harbored frameshift mutations in the C-terminal region of CALR, truncating the ER-targeting domain of the protein. The mutual-exclusivity with JAK2 mutation, and the activation of STAT signaling in cells expressing the mutated calreticulin protein, suggests that CALR mutation may be redundant with JAK2 mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms, and that JAK inhibitors may be effective in treating tumors with CALR mutation (PMID: 24645956, 24325359, 24366362). Somatic CALR mutations are also found in familial cases of thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis, again mutual exclusive with JAK2 variants (PMID: 24553179).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":811,"hugoSymbol":"CALR","name":"calreticulin","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000316448","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004343.3","geneAliases":["SSA","cC1qR","CRT","HEL-S-99n","RO"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"7556879","title":"Calreticulin modulates the in vitro DNA binding but not the in vivo transcriptional activation by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/retinoid X receptor heterodimers.","journal":"Molecular and cellular endocrinology","pubDate":"1995 Jun","volume":"111","issue":"2","pages":"175-9","authors":"Winrow CJ et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Winrow CJ et al.
