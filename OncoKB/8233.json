[{"evidenceId":18324,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"ZRSR2 encodes a splicing factor U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 35 kDa subunit-related protein 2. It is involved in the splicing of introns and is important for recognizing the 3' splice site and assembly of the spliceosome (PMID:21041408). Mutation in hematopoietic cells results in mis-splicing and retention of the U12 type intron in pre-messenger RNA (PMID:25586593). Mutations are found in myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and other myeloid dysorders (PMID: 22389253, 25550361, 25212276). Targeted inhibition of the spliceosome may be a therapeutic strategy in spliceosome mutant disease (PMID:26575690).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8233,"hugoSymbol":"ZRSR2","name":"zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000307771","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005089.3","geneAliases":["URP","ZC3H22","U2AF1-RS2","U2AF1RS2","U2AF1L2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25586593","title":"Aberrant splicing of U12-type introns is the hallmark of ZRSR2 mutant myelodysplastic syndrome.","journal":"Nature communications","pubDate":"2015 Jan 14","volume":"6","issue":"","pages":"6042","authors":"Madan V et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ncomms7042","link":null,"reference":"Madan V et al.
