TAP1 is involved in the transport of antigens from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as their association with MHC class I molecules (PMID: 14679198, 12594855, 17947644, 22638925). TAP1 overexpression has been associated with prostate cancer progression and breast cancer metastasis (PMID: 22065046, 25403418). Mechanistically, the role of TAP1 in cancer is unclear, but it likely has a role in cell proliferation (PMID: 25398693).
