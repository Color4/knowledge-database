The p27 protein is ubiquitously expressed and located both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (PMID: 8033212). Nuclear p27 functions as a tumor suppressor by controlling cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, specifically by inhibiting the binding of cyclin A and E to CDK2 (PMID: 18354415). Conversely, cytoplasmic p27 has a pro-oncogenic role by stimulating cell migration through mechanisms largely independent of its CDK-inhibiting function (PMID: 15573116, 17909030). Although genetic deletion and inhibited transcription of CDKN1B are rare in human cancer, low p27 levels due to increased protein degradation are prevalent in several different types of epithelial tumors, and are commonly correlated with aggressive tumor growth and poor clinical outcome (PMID: 15573116, 12507555, 10699961).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1027,"hugoSymbol":"CDKN1B","name":"cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000228872","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004064.3","geneAliases":["CDKN4","MEN1B","MEN4","P27KIP1","KIP1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"18354415","title":"The Cdk inhibitor p27 in human cancer: prognostic potential and relevance to anticancer therapy.","journal":"Nature reviews.
