[{"evidenceId":19766,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CDK8 (cell division protein kinase 8) encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase involved in DNA transcription. CDK8 associates with Cyclin C (CCNC), Med12 and Med13 to from a module that associates with the Mediator complex, which is involved in the regulation of DNA transcription (PMID: 7568034). CDK8 associates and phosphorylates the c-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II at Ser2 and Ser5 (PMID: 10023686, 11278802). CDK8 has been reported to have positive as well as negative effects on gene transcription depending on the genes analyzed. CDK8 seems involved in the maintenance of tumor stemness (PMID: 22345154) and CDK8 is a positive regulator of oncogene growth response by enabling efficient transcriptional elongation through recruitment of pTEF-B and BRD4 to oncogenic genes (PMID: 20098423). CDK8 phosphorylates E2F1 at S375 and inactivates its ability to repress transcription of oncogenic target genes (PMID: 22945643). CDK8 enables gene expression at p53 target genes (PMID: 17612495) and beta-catenin driven gene transcription in colon cancer requires CDK8 kinase activity (PMID: 18794900, 19808961). CDK8 is also required for the induction of HIF1A target gene transcription (PMID: 23746844). In AML, however, CDK8 has been shown to restrain mediator mediated super-enhancer-driven transcription (PMID: 26416749, 10993082, 7568034). Consistent with these findings, yeast CDK8 blocks interaction of RNA polymerase with mediator complex (PMID: 17043218, 23563140). CDK8 has been found amplified in a large number of colorectal cancers (PMID: 18794900, 19808961). Inhibiton of CDK8 with small molecules has been evaluated for anticancer treatment and it has been shown that CDK8 inhibition increases sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy in vitro (PMID: 22869755).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1024,"hugoSymbol":"CDK8","name":"cyclin dependent kinase 8","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000381527","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001260.1","geneAliases":["K35"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"10023686","title":"Cyclin C/CDK8 and cyclin H/CDK7/p36 are biochemically distinct CTD kinases.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"1999 Jan 28","volume":"18","issue":"4","pages":"1093-102","authors":"Rickert P et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Rickert P et al.
