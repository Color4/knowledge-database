[{"evidenceId":17655,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The NUP93 gene encodes nucleoporin 93, a subunit of the nuclear pore complex that is essential for the exchange of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. NUP93 plays an important role in ensuring the correct assembly and maintenance of the nuclear pore complex (PMID: 15229283, 22171326). It has been suggested that NUP93 plays a role in gene regulation by tethering chromatin to generate the necessary environment for transcriptional repression or activation (PMID: 26341556). Expression of NUP93, along with other members of the nucleoporin complex, is increased in cardiac tissue of patients with heart failure and decreased in the thymus of patients with Down syndrome (PMID: 23152829, 21856934). While NUP93 copy number alterations are observed in a variety of solid cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov. 2015), mutations of this gene are not frequent. However, a recent analysis identified the NUP93 E14K mutation as a hotspot mutation in multiple cancers (PMID: 26619011). Whole-exome and RNA sequencing detected a fusion gene between NUP93 and CYB5B in glioblastoma cell lines (PMID: 26496030).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9688,"hugoSymbol":"NUP93","name":"nucleoporin 93","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000308159","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014669.4","geneAliases":["NIC96","NPHS12"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26619011","title":"Identifying recurrent mutations in cancer reveals widespread lineage diversity and mutational specificity.","journal":"Nature biotechnology","pubDate":"2016 Feb","volume":"34","issue":"2","pages":"155-63","authors":"Chang MT et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nbt.3391","link":null,"reference":"Chang MT et al.
