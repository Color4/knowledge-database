[{"evidenceId":4697,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MYOD gene encodes a member of the bHLH family of transcription factors. MYOD, together with the closely related MYF5, MRF4 and MYOGENIN regulatory transcription factors, control myogenic differentiation. MYOD commits mesoderm cells to a skeletal myoblast lineage and regulates their continued state and it can also regulate muscle repair (PMID:16099183). MYOD removes cells from from the cell cycle by increasing the transcription of p21 and myogenin and this is important to switch cellular proliferation to differentiation. Loss of this control would lead to the formation of rhabdomysarcoma (PMID:16099183, PMID 12783965).
