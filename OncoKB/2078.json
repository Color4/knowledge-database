In normal physiology, ERG is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells where it is required for normal hematopoiesis (PMID: 18500345) and endothelial cells where it regulates angiogenesis and vascular stability (PMID: 25584796). ERG fusions are the most common alterations of the ERG gene and are found in several cancers, including prostate cancer (PMID: 16254181) and Ewing’s sarcoma (PMID: 8162068). In prostate cancer, approximately 50% of all cases harbor a fusion between ERG and a highly expressed gene (e.g., TMPRSS2) that leads to aberrant overexpression of ERG (PMID: 16254181). In these cases, ERG acts to modify the chromatin landscape of prostate cancer cells, allowing for increased androgen receptor (AR) binding and priming prostate cancer initiation in response to PTEN loss (PMID: 23817021, 28783165).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2078,"hugoSymbol":"ERG","name":"ERG, ETS transcription factor","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000288319","curatedRefSeq":"NM_182918.3","geneAliases":["p55","erg-3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23817021","title":"ETS factors reprogram the androgen receptor cistrome and prime prostate tumorigenesis in response to PTEN loss.","journal":"Nature medicine","pubDate":"2013 Aug","volume":"19","issue":"8","pages":"1023-9","authors":"Chen Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nm.3216","link":null,"reference":"Chen Y et al.
