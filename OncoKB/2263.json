[{"evidenceId":5261,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family includes 4 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), FGFR1-4. Signaling by FGFRs occurs upon ligand-dependent dimerization that activates the tyrosine kinase domain. Dysregulated FGFR function due to amplification, mutation, translocation, alternative splicing, or increased activation by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) can contribute to increased signaling, oncogenesis, and cell migration (PMID: 20094046). FGFR2 kinase domain mutations are reminiscent of those found in craniofacial syndrome and primarily occur in endometrial, cervical, and squamous cell lung cancers, whereas FGFR2 amplifications have been identified in approximately 10% of gastric cancers and are associated with poor prognosis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in FGFR2 have been linked to the development of ER-positive breast cancer, although the etiology remains unclear (PMID: 18437204). FGFR2 mutations are also very frequent in ameloblastomas. Together with BRAF, RAS and FGFR2 mutations were present in 44 out of 50 amelobasltomas cases (88%) (PMID: 24993163).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2263,"hugoSymbol":"FGFR2","name":"fibroblast growth factor receptor 2","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000358487","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000141.4","geneAliases":["BBDS","BFR-1","CEK3","JWS","BEK","K-SAM","KGFR","ECT1","TK14","TK25","CD332","CFD1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20094046","title":"Fibroblast growth factor signalling: from development to cancer.","journal":"Nature reviews.
