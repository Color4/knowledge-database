[{"evidenceId":18671,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"SYK encodes spleen tyrosine kinase, a signal transduction kinase that is recruited to cell surface receptors through binding of its SH2 domain and activated by phosphorylation (PMID:7538118). Syk activity is needed for B-cell and lymphatic system development (PMID:7477353,12522250). It is expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells but also in subsets of epithelial cancers regulating tumor invasion (PMID:10963601,17699797, 23609194). Activation of Syk may also be a mechanism of ovarian cancer cell chemo-resistance (PMID:26096845). It participates in signal transduction from the immunglobulin receptor in B-cells (PMID:23335753). Syk can activate Flt3 and is important for leukemia survival (PMID:24525236,19800574). Targeting SYK signaling is a potential therapeutic strategy in lymphoma therapy (PMID:26575169, 23764004). Case reports of translocations involving SYK have been reported in MDS and lymphomas (PMID:11159536,16341044).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6850,"hugoSymbol":"SYK","name":"spleen associated tyrosine kinase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000375746","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003177.5","geneAliases":["p72-Syk"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19800574","title":"Proteomic and genetic approaches identify Syk as an AML target.","journal":"Cancer cell","pubDate":"2009 Oct 6","volume":"16","issue":"4","pages":"281-94","authors":"Hahn CK et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2009.08.018","link":null,"reference":"Hahn CK et al.
