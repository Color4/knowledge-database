Specifically, B2M serves as the light chain of the MHC class I molecule, which functions to present peptides derived from cellular proteins to CD8+ T lymphocytes, a process critical to adaptive immune responses (PMID: 8717519). Loss-of-function B2M genomic alterations may contribute to tumor immune evasion and are prevalent in colorectal cancer and melanoma (PMID: 22833104). Additionally, serum levels of free soluble B2M are increased in many hematological and solid malignancies. Various non-immunologic context-dependent functions have been ascribed to free B2M; these include serving as a mitogenic or pro-apoptotic paracrine factor in various tumor types (PMID: 23848204, 19056512). Elevated serum B2M is a strong prognostic indicator of poor outcomes in many hematological malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, although the precise mechanism underlying this correlation is not fully understood (PMID: 8507875, 15809451, 8471438).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":567,"hugoSymbol":"B2M","name":"beta-2-microglobulin","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000558401","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004048.2","geneAliases":["IMD43"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22833104","title":"Implication of the β2-microglobulin gene in the generation of tumor escape phenotypes.","journal":"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII","pubDate":"2012 Sep","volume":"61","issue":"9","pages":"1359-71","authors":"Bernal M et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1321-6","link":null,"reference":"Bernal M et al.
