BRD4 binds to acetylated histone lysine motifs and helps recruit members of the transcriptional regulator complex, including P-TEFb and Mediator, which are necessary for PolII-dependent transcriptional elongation (PMID: 24751816). BRD4 has been shown to have a role in inflammation (PMID: 21068722, 25263595), viral gene expression (PMID: 16109376) and heart failure (PMID: 23911322). A subset of regulatory elements termed 'super-enhancers' are bound by high levels of BRD4 and are particularly prone to transcriptional perturbations of BRD4 inhibition (BETi) via small molecules (PMID: 24905006, 23582323). For example, BETi results in significant reduction of MYC downstream activity via its super-enhancer. As such, experimental data has shown that MYC-driven cancers are particularly sensitive to BETi, including multiple myeloma (PMID: 21889194) and medulloblastoma (PMID: 24297863). A chromosomal BRD4-NUT fusion product is a driver of disease in most cases of NUT midline carcinoma and is sensitive to BETi (PMID: 20871596). Resistance to BETi can arise due to BRD4 hyperphosphorylation in breast cancer (PMID: 26735014), and SPOP mutations, which can lead to BRD4 stabilization in prostate cancer (PMID: 28805820).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-25","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":23476,"hugoSymbol":"BRD4","name":"bromodomain containing 4","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263377","curatedRefSeq":"NM_058243.2","geneAliases":["HUNKI","MCAP","CAP","HUNK1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20871596","title":"Selective inhibition of BET bromodomains.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2010 Dec 23","volume":"468","issue":"7327","pages":"1067-73","authors":"Filippakopoulos P et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature09504","link":null,"reference":"Filippakopoulos P et al.
