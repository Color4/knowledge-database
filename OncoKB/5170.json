[{"evidenceId":18649,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PDPK1 (also known as PDK1) encodes for 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 that mediates downstream signaling from phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). It is a serine threonine kinase that responds to mitogenic and insulin signals to phosphorylate targets including the AGC family of kinases such as p70 S6K and AKT (PMID:10801415, 9094314, 9427642). Breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells have shown dependency on PDPK1 for survival and tumor progression (PMID:19573809, 25269480). In pancreatic cancer, PDPK1 signaling can contribute to Kras oncogenic activity (PMID:23453624). The PDPK1 gene has been found to be amplified in breast and thyroid cancers (PMID:19602588, 18492751). Inhibitors are in development for different tumor types, particularly in breast cancer (PMID:22491800, 24039447, 21568903, 24037523)","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5170,"hugoSymbol":"PDPK1","name":"3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000342085","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002613.4","geneAliases":["PRO0461","PDPK2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9427642","title":"3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphorylates and activates the p70 S6 kinase in vivo and in vitro.","journal":"Current biology : CB","pubDate":"1998 Jan 15","volume":"8","issue":"2","pages":"69-81","authors":"Alessi DR et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Alessi DR et al.
