Binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of PDGFRA, which contains immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, causes dimerization followed by autophosphorylation of the receptor and activation of downstream pathways such as RAS-MAPK, PI3K and PLC-γ that are involved in developmental and cellular responses. The catalytic activity of PDGFRA is mediated through the split intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; PDGFRA binds to all PDGF ligand isoforms except PDGF-DD (PMID:18483217, 24703957). Mutations, insertions, deletions, fusions and genomic amplification of PDGFRA lead to its activation in several tumor types: ~7% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have PDGFRA activating mutations and these mutations are mutually exclusive from KIT mutations (PMID: 20023271); activating mutations in PDGFRA have been been reported in ~5% of Chinese melanoma patients (PMID:24132921); amplification of PDGFRA is the second most frequent receptor tyrosine kinase amplification in glioblastoma (GBM), is found in ~7-15% of GBM tumors and is often associated with in-frame deletions (PMID:18772890,19915670, 22323597, 20129251, 20889717); amplification of the PDGFRA locus has been reported in more than 80% of intimal sarcomas (PMID:20685895), ~19% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PMID:16357008), 3–7% of non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas and 8–10% non-small cell lung squamous cell carcinomas (PMID:19755855); activating mutations have been found in ~5% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and in ~14% of non-brain stem pediatric high-grade gliomas, around 40% of these occurring in the context of PDGFRA amplification (PMID:23970477); chimeric fusion transcripts to the catalytic domain of PDGFRA have been reported in select cases of GBM (PMID:20889717), chronic myeloid leukemia (PMID:12023981,12944919, 15034867) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) (PMID:12660384, 19187542, 16498388, 16845659, 17555450). PDGFRA mutations have also been reported in inflammatory fibroid polyps (PMID: 22394371), and these mutations have been characterized as activating in other disease types.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5156,"hugoSymbol":"PDGFRA","name":"platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000257290","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006206.4","geneAliases":["PDGFR2","RHEPDGFRA","GAS9","PDGFR-2","CD140A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17555450","title":"Two novel imatinib-responsive PDGFRA fusion genes in chronic eosinophilic leukaemia.","journal":"British journal of haematology","pubDate":"2007 Jul","volume":"138","issue":"1","pages":"77-81","authors":"Curtis CE et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Curtis CE et al.
