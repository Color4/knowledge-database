[{"evidenceId":5685,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"BBC3 (BCL2 binding component 3, also known as PUMA) is a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein. BBC3 contains a BH3 (BCL-2 homology 3) domain, which allows for binding to anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, including BCL-xL and BCL-2. This releases the pro-apoptotic factors BAK and BAX, which in turn triggers apoptosis by permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane (PMID: 11463392, 17322918). BBC3 is a transcriptional target of p53, but it is also activated independently of p53 in response to cellular stress; thus, BBC3 is considered both a p53-dependent and -independent pro-apoptotic factor (PMID: 14585359, 19641508). Although methylation-dependent silencing has been described in Burkitt lymphomas, genetic or epigenetic inactivation of BBC3 is not commonly found in human cancers (PMID: 17267315, 18573879). However, BBC3 function can be altered as a consequence of perturbations of other factors in the apoptosis pathways, such as mutations in TP53 which abrogate its ability to induce BBC3 expression (PMID: 21478674). BBC3 is a highly efficient effector of apoptosis in model systems and the BH3 domain of BBC3 and other pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins is being investigated as a therapeutic option in the shape of BH3 mimetic peptides and small molecules (PMID: 17921043, 11463391, 19641508).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":27113,"hugoSymbol":"BBC3","name":"BCL2 binding component 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000449228","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001127240.2","geneAliases":["JFY-1","JFY1","PUMA"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"14585359","title":"Puma is an essential mediator of p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways.","journal":"Cancer cell","pubDate":"2003 Oct","volume":"4","issue":"4","pages":"321-8","authors":"Jeffers JR et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Jeffers JR et al.
