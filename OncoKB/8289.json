This complex plays a role in altering chromatin structure, a process that is necessary for various cellular functions, including transcription, DNA synthesis and DNA repair (PMID: 10757798, 21900401, reviewed in PMID: 25387058). ARID1A binds to DNA without any sequence specificity. However, by recruiting other members of the SWI/SWF complex to DNA, it is thought to confer specificity in the regulation of gene expression (PMID: 14982958, 10757798, 11073988). Germline mutations in ARID1A result in Coffin-Siris syndrome, which is characterized by developmental delay, fifth finger or toe abnormalities, and \"coarse\" facial features (reviewed in PMID: 11170086). Additionally, ARID1A has been identified as a tumor suppressor in gynecologic cancers (PMID: 21900401).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-24","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8289,"hugoSymbol":"ARID1A","name":"AT-rich interaction domain 1A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000324856","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006015.4","geneAliases":["MRD14","hOSA1","BAF250a","C1orf4","hELD","SMARCF1","BM029","CSS2","OSA1","BAF250","B120","ELD","P270"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"11073988","title":"A specificity and targeting subunit of a human SWI/SNF family-related chromatin-remodeling complex.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"2000 Dec","volume":"20","issue":"23","pages":"8879-88","authors":"Nie Z et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Nie Z et al.
