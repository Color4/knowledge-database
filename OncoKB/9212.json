[{"evidenceId":5875,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The AURKB gene encodes serine/threonine kinase involved in mitosis and cytokinesis. AURKB protein is expressed in proliferating cells during G2 and mitosis. AURKB phosphorylates multiple proteins to maintain genome integrity through the establishment of proper chromosome-spindle attachments and the spindle assembly checkpoint (also known as the mitotic checkpoint) (PMID: 12707311, 14767480) and is essential for cytokinesis (PMID: 11050385). Increased AURKB expression often correlates with poor prognosis in multiple cancers (e.g., colorectal (PMID: 10393726) and hepatocellular carcinomas (PMID: 20799978)). However, the functional implication of dysregulated AURKB expression has not been established. Indeed, because the AURKB kinase is essential for cell division it is possible that increased AURKB expression reflects increased proliferation of cancer cells compared to normal cells. Finally, although inhibitors of Aurora kinases (including AURKB) have recently entered into clinical trials as anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics (PMID: 24965505), none are yet FDA-approved and their efficacy specifically towards tumors with aberrations in AURKB expression is not currently being investigated.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9212,"hugoSymbol":"AURKB","name":"aurora kinase B","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000585124","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004217.3","geneAliases":["PPP1R48","AIK2","AIM1","STK12","ARK2","aurkb-sv2","aurkb-sv1","AurB","STK5","IPL1","AIM-1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12707311","title":"The small molecule Hesperadin reveals a role for Aurora B in correcting kinetochore-microtubule attachment and in maintaining the spindle assembly checkpoint.","journal":"The Journal of cell biology","pubDate":"2003 Apr 28","volume":"161","issue":"2","pages":"281-94","authors":"Hauf S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Hauf S et al.
