The helicase activity of RTEL1 is essential in disassemblingtelomere loops and suppressing telomere fragility to maintain the integrity ofchromosome ends (PMID: 24115439). In addition, it interacts with proteins inthe shelterin complex known to protect telomeres during DNA replication (PMID:23959892). It also acts as an anti-recombinase to affect disassembly of toxicDNA recombination intermediates, and thus regulates meiotic recombination andcrossover homeostasis (PMID: 18957201).
