[{"evidenceId":19059,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The gene NOTCH4 encodes a member of the Notch family that binds Jagged1/2, and Delta 1, which leads to activation of the Notch proteins. (PMID: 10221902, 9245493) NOTCH4 is a type I transmembrane receptor composed of an extracellular domain containing epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain containing several conserved protein domain that plays a key role in cellular signaling and cell-fate determination through the NOTCH signaling pathway. (PMID: 19165418) First identified as int-3 in retrovirus-induced murine mammary cancer (PMID: 1372276), NOTCH4 is often truncated to form an oncoprotein that has most of the extracellular domain deleted and consists of the remaining transmembrane and an activated intracellular domain. (PMID: 9576833) Expression of this activated NOTCH4 disrupts mammary gland morphogenesis and promotes the formation of undifferentiated carcinomas. (PMID:11344305, 8620493) In a study looking at the prognostic value of NOTCH receptors in breast cancer, NOTCH4 demonstrated oncogenic capabilities in mammary carcinogenesis and overexpression of NOTCH4 in patients with breast cancer correlated with better overall survival. (PMID: 10797286, 26323259) In gastric tumors, NOTCH4 activation was shown to promote tumor growth by inducing Wnt1/β-catenin signaling. (PMID: 25511451) In contrast, in melanoma cell lines expressing the activated NOTCH4, NOTCH4 behaved like a tumor suppressor and reduced tumor growth.
