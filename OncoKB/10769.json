PLK2 is involved in regulating many pathways including angiogenesis, skeletal development, neuronal differentiation, synapse formation, centrosome duplication, and mitochondrial respiration response (PMID:26004360, 12972611, 25590559, 19706541,18498738, 19700763). PLK2 also phosphorylates alpha-synculine that may have a role in Parkinsons disease (PMID:19004816, 23983262). In cancer cells PLK2 mediates chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance, apoptosis, and proliferation (PMID:21402713,19764992,25501818,16160013, 12897130, 26640387, 23703673).
