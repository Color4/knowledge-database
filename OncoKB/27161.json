Argonaute 2 forms part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and has endonuclease activity (PMID: 15105377, 23746446). Argonaute 2 represents the catalytic element of the RISC complex, and upon single stranded RNA-mediated, complementarity-based recognition of mRNAs, either cleaves or inhibits translation of its targets (PMID: 19239886, 23654304).
