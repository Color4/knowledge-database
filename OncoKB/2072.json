The ERCC4-ERCC1 complex is required to cut at the junction between double stranded and single stranded DNA and has important functions in nucleotide excision repair, DNA double-strand break repair, and DNA interstrand crosslinks repair (PMID: 22101340, 9525876). Hereditary mutations in ERCC4 have been identified in skin-photosensitive and DNA repair deficient disorders including xeroderma pigmentosum, Cocakyane synrome, XFE progeroid syndrome and Fanconi Anemia (PMID: 23623386, 23623389). Somatic ERCC4 mutations are rare in cancer, however, loss-of-function germline ERCC4 mutations can cause a predisposition for cancer (PMID: 22941649, 24465539). ERCC4-mutant cell are sensitive to DNA damaging reagents due to deficiencies in DNA repair pathways (PMID: 26074087).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2072,"hugoSymbol":"ERCC4","name":"ERCC excision repair 4, endonuclease catalytic subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000311895","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005236.2","geneAliases":["XFEPS","FANCQ","ERCC11","XPF"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"9525876","title":"DNA structural elements required for ERCC1-XPF endonuclease activity.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"1998 Apr 3","volume":"273","issue":"14","pages":"7835-42","authors":"de Laat WL et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"de Laat WL et al.
