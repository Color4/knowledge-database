DNMT3B is essential for the establishment of epigenetics patterns during development and its loss results in an early embryonic lethal phenotype (PMID: 10555141). It is involved in gene silencing through DNA methylation, including imprinted genes, genes on the inactive X chromosome and repetitive sequences, as well as through methylation-independent transcriptional co-repression (PMID: 17616512, 17708532, 22956494). All DNMTs play an important role in maintaining chromosomal integrity (PMID: 21927626). Biallelic mutations in DNMT3B are associated with ICF (immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial abnormalities) syndrome (PMID: 10647011, 16501171). Mutations of the DNMT3B gene are distributed throughout its open reading frame, a pattern consistent with the loss-of-function hypothesis. Dysregulated expression of DNMTs and aberrant DNA methylation patterns (both hypo- and hypermethylation) are found in various cancer types at low frequencies (PMID: 21941284, 22037554, 22895193; cBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2015). Promoter CpG island hypermethylation is implicated in transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes, while global DNA hypomethylation may be linked to genomic instability and to de-repression of stem cell genes and proto-oncogenes.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-02-21","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1789,"hugoSymbol":"DNMT3B","name":"DNA methyltransferase 3 beta","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000328111","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006892.3","geneAliases":["ICF1","M.HsaIIIB","ICF"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22956494","title":"DNA methyltransferases, DNA damage repair, and cancer.","journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","pubDate":"2013","volume":"754","issue":"","pages":"3-29","authors":"Jin B et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1007/978-1-4419-9967-2_1","link":null,"reference":"Jin B et al.
