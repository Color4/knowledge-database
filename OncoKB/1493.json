[{"evidenceId":19744,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen-4) gene encodes a transmembrane immunoglobulin receptor that blocks activation of T-lymphocytes (PMID: 9653097). CTLA4 binds to ligand B7-1 and B7-2, present on antigen presenting cells (PMID: 7543139). Binding of these ligands prevents their binding to CD28, the co-stimulatory molecule on T-cells, and also transduces an inhibitory signal within the T-cell (PMID: 11244047). Inhibition of CTLA4 has been employed in immune therapy of cancer by allowing activation of tumor specific T-cells (PMID: 20525992). Inherited mutations in CTLA4 lead to immune dysregulation, hyper-activated T-cells and loss of normal circulating B-cells (PMID: 25213377). Polymorphisms and mutations in CTLA4 are associated with autoimmune disease (PMID: 25695113, 25329329).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1493,"hugoSymbol":"CTLA4","name":"cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000302823","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005214.4","geneAliases":["ALPS5","CD","CD152","CELIAC3","IDDM12","GSE","CTLA-4","GRD4"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9653097","title":"B7-1 engagement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 inhibits T cell activation in the absence of CD28.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","pubDate":"1998 Jul 6","volume":"188","issue":"1","pages":"205-10","authors":"Fallarino F et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Fallarino F et al.
