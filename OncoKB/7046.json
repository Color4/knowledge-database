[{"evidenceId":10810,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The TGBR1 gene encodes transforming growth factor receptor ß (TGFß) receptor 1, a type-I member of the family of TGFß receptors. TGBR1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that heterodimerizes with other receptor-family members upon binding of a ligand belonging to the TGFß family. Following ligand activation, TGFBR1 phosphorylates its dimerization partner and induces phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as the SMAD proteins which control gene regulation (PMID: 22992590, 18662538). TGFß signaling controls multiple biological processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation and tissue homeostasis and, as such, is implicated in multiple human disorders (PMID: 22992590, 11057902). TGF-ß can function both as a tumor suppressor and tumor promoter (PMID: 11057902, 20001556). Inactivating mutations in TGBR1 have been detected in ovarian and breast cancer while deletions have been observed in pancreatic and biliary cancers as well as lymphomas (PMID: 22992590, 11057902). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in TGFBR1 can cause the autosomal Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 1 and have also been found in individuals with Marfan and similar syndromes (PMID: 16928994,16791849, 16596670, 18781618). Mutations associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome were shown in cell lines to inactive the receptor function and to predispose carriers to allergic disorders (PMID: 22414221, 23884466). Other hereditary variants have been found to be associated with non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 21225232, 19690145). Targeting of the TGFß pathway is being explored as a therapeutic approach in multiple cancers, focusing on either the production of ligand, its receptors or the downstream mediators; these therapies are based on the idea that TGFß exerts an immunosuppressive effect in certain tumors (PMID: 11057902, 18662538). Small molecules inhibiting TGFBR1's kinase function have entered into clinical trials (PMID: 11057902, 18662538).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":7046,"hugoSymbol":"TGFBR1","name":"transforming growth factor beta receptor 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000374994","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004612.2","geneAliases":["TGFR-1","LDS1A","LDS2A","LDS1","ALK5","ACVRLK4","ESS1","MSSE","SKR4","tbetaR-I","AAT5","ALK-5"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"16596670","title":"FBN1, TGFBR1, and the Marfan-craniosynostosis/mental retardation disorders revisited.","journal":"American journal of medical genetics.
