PREX2 is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and G-protein coupled receptors and mediates the PI3K pathway-dependent activation of RAC1 (PMID: 15304343, 15304342, 15897194). PREX2 can activate the PI3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway by antagonizing PTEN inhibitory effects (PMID: 19729658); conversely, PTEN negatively regulates PREX2-mediated oncogenic effects (PMID: 25829446). PREX2 activation increases cell proliferation, activates PI3K signaling and downregulates tumor suppressors such as CDKN1C in NRAS-mutant melanoma (PMID: 25829446, 26884185). Oncogenic effects of PREX2 have also been described in other cancers (PMID: 26718453), as well as a role for PREX2 in the insulin signaling pathway (PMID: 26438819). PREX2 is mutated in melanomas and other skin cancers, as well as in pancreatic tumors (PMID: 22622578, 25719666; cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":80243,"hugoSymbol":"PREX2","name":"phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate dependent Rac exchange factor 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000288368","curatedRefSeq":"NM_024870.2","geneAliases":["PPP1R129","DEP.2","P-REX2","DEPDC2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25829446","title":"PTEN inhibits PREX2-catalyzed activation of RAC1 to restrain tumor cell invasion.","journal":"Science signaling","pubDate":"2015 Mar 31","volume":"8","issue":"370","pages":"ra32","authors":"Mense SM et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1126/scisignal.2005840","link":null,"reference":"Mense SM et al.
