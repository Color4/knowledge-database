NSD1 has a unique role as a bifunctional cofactor that can both positively and negatively regulate transcription (PMID: 12805229, 9628876, 11733144). Additionally, NSD1 contains a SET domain with histone methyltransferase activity (with specificity for H3K36 and H4K20), and PHD domains that recognize methylated histone lysines (PMID: 12805229, 21972110). H3K36 methylation most commonly is associated with activation of gene transcription, but may also affect other processes such as DNA repair or RNA splicing (PMID: 22266761). Germline mutations of NSD1 are associated with Sotos syndrome, characterized by overgrowth, distinctive appearance, and developmental delay (PMID: 11896389). The mutation results in global genomic methylation changes including loci involved in neuronal differentiation (PMID: 26690673). Mutations are found in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and leukemias (PMID: 25631445, 26438511, 25056374, 22976956). Translocations involving NSD1 and the NUP98 gene are highly prevalent in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and are associated with a poor prognosis (PMID:11895789, 23630019, PMID: 24951466 ).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-08","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":64324,"hugoSymbol":"NSD1","name":"nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000439151","curatedRefSeq":"NM_022455.4","geneAliases":["KMT3B","SOTOS1","SOTOS","ARA267","STO"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"24951466","title":"Potent co-operation between the NUP98-NSD1 fusion and the FLT3-ITD mutation in acute myeloid leukemia induction.","journal":"Haematologica","pubDate":"2014 Sep","volume":"99","issue":"9","pages":"1465-71","authors":"Thanasopoulou A et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.100917","link":null,"reference":"Thanasopoulou A et al.
