[{"evidenceId":8318,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2) protein is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH2 utilizes NADP(+) as an electron acceptor and it is expressed in the mitochondria, where it plays a role in cell metabolism and energy production via TCA cycle. Cancer-associated mutations in the catalytic site of IDH2 confer a gain-of-function of neomorphic enzymatic activity allowing the mutant enzyme to convert α-KG to the “oncometabolite” D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (PMID: 20171147). 2-HG promotes tumor development by inhibiting a variety of enzymes that require α-KG as a substrate, including enzymes involved in DNA demethylation, histone demethylation, adaptation to hypoxia and collagen maturation (PMID: 23630074). IDH2 mutations have been identified in hematologic malignancies, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as in solid tumors such as gliomas and cholangiocarcinomas.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-08-02","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3418,"hugoSymbol":"IDH2","name":"isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 2, mitochondrial","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000330062","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002168.2","geneAliases":["IDHM","IDP","D2HGA2","mNADP-IDH","IDPM","IDH","ICD-M"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23630074","title":"What a difference a hydroxyl makes: mutant IDH, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and cancer.","journal":"Genes &amp; development","pubDate":"2013 Apr 15","volume":"27","issue":"8","pages":"836-52","authors":"Losman JA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1101/gad.217406.113","link":null,"reference":"Losman JA et al.
