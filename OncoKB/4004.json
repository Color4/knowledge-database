The Lim-domain-only proteins (LMO1-4) are characterized by two tandemly arrayed protein interacting LIM domains. The LIM domain is similar to a zinc finger domain; however, instead of mediating DNA-interactions it mediates protein-protein interactions (PMID: 10704826). LMO1 was first described to have oncogenic functions in T-lymphoblastic leukemia. It is was found to be located near chromosome 11 translocation breakpoints leading to overexpression in these leukemias (PMID: 2034676, 2115645). LMO1 expression can drive leukemiagenesis and forms protein complexes with TAL1 and other proteins. LMO1 protein complexes regulate transcription of known oncogenes such as MYB, one mechanism through which LMO1 leads to leukemogenesis (PMID: 22897851, 1508213). LMO1 is also described as an oncogene in neuroblastoma. A subset of neuroblastoma is robustly associated with germline sequence variants close to the LMO1 gene (PMID: 21124317). These sequence variants lead to high LMO1 expression throught differential GATA transcription factor binding (PMID: 26560027). It is clear that LMO1 is associated with poor survival and higher risk of metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of actions are not well understood (PMID: 23303138).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4004,"hugoSymbol":"LMO1","name":"LIM domain only 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000335790","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002315.2","geneAliases":["RBTN1","RHOM1","TTG1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"26560027","title":"Genetic predisposition to neuroblastoma mediated by a LMO1 super-enhancer polymorphism.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"2015 Dec 17","volume":"528","issue":"7582","pages":"418-21","authors":"Oldridge DA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nature15540","link":null,"reference":"Oldridge DA et al.
