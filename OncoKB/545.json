[{"evidenceId":5943,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the DNA damage response. ATR responds to DNA damage and single-strand DNA by activating cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA repair pathways (PMID:12791985, 20818375, 11114888, 17157788). It is also involved in regulating telomere maintenance, initiation of DNA replication, and meiosis (PMID:17687332,15220931, 23824539, ). Germline mutations of ATR are associated with cancer predisposition and Seckel syndrome, a condition associated with central nervous system (CNS) disorders (PMID:22341969, 12640452). Somatic mutations are associated with microsatellite instability and are found in colon, urothelial, gastric, and endometrial cancer, and myelomas (PMID:11691784,16288216,17879369,26282654, 19470935). Kinase inhibitors of ATR are in development to enhance chemotherapy response and for treatment of DNA repair pathway deficient cancers (PMID: 26517239, 21552262, 26312880, 26486089).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":545,"hugoSymbol":"ATR","name":"ATR serine/threonine kinase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000350721","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001184.3","geneAliases":["SCKL1","MEC1","SCKL","FRP1","FCTCS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"11691784","title":"Somatic mutations in the DNA damage-response genes ATR and CHK1 in sporadic stomach tumors with microsatellite instability.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2001 Nov 1","volume":"61","issue":"21","pages":"7727-30","authors":"Menoyo A et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Menoyo A et al.
