MITF regulates proliferation and differentiation of neural crest melanocyte progenitor cells (PMID: 16862190). It cooperates with BRAF mutations in the transformation process of melanocytes to malignant melanoma. MITF is amplified in >15% of metastatic melanoma (PMID: 12789286). Its proliferative activity seems to be mediated by Ink4a, RB1 and CDK2 and MITF has anti-apoptotic acitvity mediated by BCL2 (PMID: 12086670,15607961, 15623583, 15716956).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-24","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4286,"hugoSymbol":"MITF","name":"melanogenesis associated transcription factor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000352241","curatedRefSeq":"NM_198159.2","geneAliases":["bHLHe32","WS2A","WS2","CMM8","MI"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15623583","title":"MITF links differentiation with cell cycle arrest in melanocytes by transcriptional activation of INK4A.","journal":"The Journal of cell biology","pubDate":"2005 Jan 3","volume":"168","issue":"1","pages":"35-40","authors":"Loercher AE et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Loercher AE et al.
