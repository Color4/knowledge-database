[{"evidenceId":19021,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The PDCD1LG2 gene encodes the \"programmed cell death 1 ligand 2\" (PD-L2) protein. PD-L2 is highly similar to PD-L1, a protein whose overexpression by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) leads to negative regulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and subsequent tumor immune evasion (PMID: 15599732, 22437870). PD-L2 binding affinity for PD-1 is higher than PD-L1, although the biological consequences of this are unknown (PMID: 12893276). PD-L2 is also expressed in activated T-helper cells type 2 (Th2), inhibiting its function and regulating IFN-Î³ production (PMID: 21752471). Impaired tumor growth has been observed in several in vitro and in vivo cancer models upon dual PD-L1/PD-L2 inhibition, but the specific additive role for the latter remains elusive (PMID: 22611421). PDCD1LG2 overexpression or amplification has been reported in renal, cervical and breast cancers, among others, and in some cases predicts poor prognosis (PMID: 26464193, 26913631, 26424759, 26752545, 26317899, 24270737, 15837746).
