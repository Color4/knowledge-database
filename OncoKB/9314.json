[{"evidenceId":19691,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The KLF4 gene encodes the Kruppel-like factor 4 transcription factor. Over-expression of KLF4 with OCTct3/4, SOX2, and c-MYC is able to induce pluripotent stem cell from adult tissues (PMID: 16904174). KLF4 regulates the development of multiple organs and tissues including the skin, cerebellum and colon (PMID: 10431239, 12015290, 18604447, 26226504 ). It is also involved in terminal differentiation of monocytes and the T-cell immune response (PMID: 18390749, 25992862). In certain cancers, KLF4 functions to regulate the differentiation of tumor cells and may have a potential tumor suppressor role (PMID: 25181544, 26113043, 26338995, 26880805, 21224073, 22284679, 26934576).
