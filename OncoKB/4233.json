[{"evidenceId":8728,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition (MET) proto-oncogene encodes the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, also called c-MET or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor. MET is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor that binds to extracellular HGF, leading to the activation of several downstream intracellular pathways. These include the PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/MEK pathways, which promote cellular growth and proliferation, motility, migration and angiogenesis (PMID: 25770121, 23867513). Dysregulation of MET via gene amplification, germline or somatic mutations or receptor overexpression has been observed in a variety of epithelial cancers, including breast (PMID: 15455388), prostate cancer (PMID 10454259), non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 9699182), renal papillary carcinoma (PMID: 24812413), hepatocellular (PMID: 24222167) and gastric carcinomas (PMID: 9759658).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4233,"hugoSymbol":"MET","name":"MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000397752","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000245.2","geneAliases":["RCCP2","HGFR","c-Met","DFNB97","AUTS9"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25770121","title":"Hepatocyte growth factor and Met in drug discovery.","journal":"Journal of biochemistry","pubDate":"2015 May","volume":"157","issue":"5","pages":"271-84","authors":"Sakai K et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1093/jb/mvv027","link":null,"reference":"Sakai K et al.
