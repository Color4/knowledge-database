[{"evidenceId":18433,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The POLE gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon, the replicative DNA polymerase that extends the leading strand during replication. POLE contains an exonuclease ('proofreading') domain, which replaces incorrectly incorporated nucleotides spontaneously during faithful replication. Several recurrent mutation hotspots in the exonuclease domain of POLE have been identified as affecting its proofreading capability and leading to ultra-high mutation rates, primarily in cancers of the colon, rectum and endometrium (uterus), among others. Mutations in the proofreading domain of POLE were reported in ~7% of endometrial cancers (PMID: 23636398, 25505230), ~3% of colorectal cancers (PMID: 25228659), and anecdotally in other tumor types including glioblastoma (PMID: 25740784). Patients with mutated, proofreading-deficient POLE in endometrial cancer have been shown to have better outcomes (PMID: 25505230, 23636398).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-08","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5426,"hugoSymbol":"POLE","name":"polymerase (DNA) epsilon, catalytic subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000320574","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006231.2","geneAliases":["POLE1","CRCS12","FILS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25228659","title":"Exonuclease mutations in DNA polymerase epsilon reveal replication strand specific mutation patterns and human origins of replication.","journal":"Genome research","pubDate":"2014 Nov","volume":"24","issue":"11","pages":"1740-50","authors":"Shinbrot E et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1101/gr.174789.114","link":null,"reference":"Shinbrot E et al.
