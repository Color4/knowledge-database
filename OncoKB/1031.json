[{"evidenceId":19738,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"CDKN2C encodes for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C. It binds to and inhibits cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) to prevent cell cycle progression at the G1 phase (PMID:11124804). Its regulation of cell division is important for B-cell, muscle, and cerebellar development (PMID: 21163929, 9528803,16864777). Expression is suppressed in cancer cells to promote cell cycle progression and induce proliferation (PMID: 22997239, 19411068, 17409423). Deletions and mutations are found in multiple cancer types including myeloma, lymphoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, melanoma, thyroid, and parathyroid cancer (PMID:25576899,16960149, 23616356, 22133722,18829482, 18381405, 11485924 ). Its has also been associated with poorer prognosis in certain cancer types (PMID: 21994415, 20303590, 15349907,19455257). Mutations or loss of expression activate cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and thus subject these tumors to greater sensitivity to CDK inhibitors (PMID:22711607).CDKN2C encodes for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C.
