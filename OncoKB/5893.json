RAD52 binds to RAD51, promoting strand exchange during homologous recombination (HR) by pairing of homologous single- and double-stranded DNA. Studies suggest RAD52 may help recruit RAD51 to DSB loci or form nucleoprotein filaments (PMID: 10212258, 8550550, 9450758, 8370524). Whereas RAD51 knockout is embryonic lethal in mice, depletion of RAD52 in mice or cell lines does not render a lethal or DSB-sensitive phenotype (PMID: 9774659, 8943369, 8692798). However, preclinical studies show that inactivation of RAD52 in cells lacking BRCA2 results in synthetic lethality (PMID: 9774659). Similar results were observed with regard to BRCA1 and PALB2, indicating that RAD52 impinges on a RAD51-mediated HR pathway separate from BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 (PMID: 22964643, 23071261). Truncating RAD52 variants have been found in familial breast and ovarian cancer, but also in healthy populations and are not believed to be cancer causing (PMID: 12883740, 10463575). RAD52 is infrequently altered in human cancers and although amplifications of its locus but evidence for a oncogenic mechanism are scarce (PMID: 26013599, [cBioPortal, MSKCC, July 2015]).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5893,"hugoSymbol":"RAD52","name":"RAD52 homolog, DNA repair protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000358495","curatedRefSeq":"NM_134424.2","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8550550","title":"Specific interactions between the human RAD51 and RAD52 proteins.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"1996 Jan 5","volume":"271","issue":"1","pages":"148-52","authors":"Shen Z et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Shen Z et al.
