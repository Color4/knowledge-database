CD79A is expressed from an early stage of B-cell development until the final stage of maturation prior to differentiation into plasma cells (PMID: 21841126, 24146823). The CD79A/CD79B complex is important for transmitting signals generated by antigen binding to the BCR into the cell to support B-cell maturation and survival (PMID: 15186779). Following BCR-ligand interaction, CD79A and CD79B are phosphorylated and activated by SRC family kinases leading to activation of downstream oncogenic signaling cascades that affect B-cell maturation (PMID: 17114463, 15699130, 20940318, 22078222,11514602). Activating mutations in CD79A have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly the activated B-cell-like subtype (PMID: 20054396), suggesting that CD79A acts as an oncogene. Such aberrations result in increased BCR signaling and ligand-independent clustering of BCRs, resulting in enhanced B-cell survival and differentiation. Antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD79A/B and inhibitors targeting SRC activity, such as dasatinib, can reduce BCR signaling (PMID: 17374736, 20054396).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-12","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":973,"hugoSymbol":"CD79A","name":"CD79a molecule","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000221972","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001783.3","geneAliases":["IGA","MB-1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17114463","title":"Analysis of the individual contributions of Igalpha (CD79a)- and Igbeta (CD79b)-mediated tonic signaling for bone marrow B cell development and peripheral B cell maturation.","journal":"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","pubDate":"2006 Dec 1","volume":"177","issue":"11","pages":"7913-22","authors":"Fuentes-Pananá EM et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Fuentes-Pananá EM et al.
