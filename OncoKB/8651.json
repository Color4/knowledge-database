[{"evidenceId":19101,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"SOCS1 encodes for the protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 that is induced by cytokine stimulation and acts in negative feedback inhibition (PMID:9202125). SOCS1 contains an SH2 domain that binds phosphotyrosine proteins including those found in cytokine receptors and JAK signaling proteins to mediate inhibition (PMID:10064597). A C-terminal SOCS box domain is also important for target protein degradation (PMID:10051596). Regulation of cytokine signaling such as IL2 and Interferons, growth factor receptors, and Toll-like receptors by SOCS1 is important for immune regulation and lymphocyte development (PMID:10490100, 14499118, 12433373, 16415872, 24086733). Its activity is regulated by microRNA miR-155 (PMID:26163372). SOCS1 acts as a tumor suppressor with mutations associated with activated JAK-STAT kinase signaling (PMID:16532038). Mutations are found in Hodgkin's lymphoma and primary mediastinal lymphomas (PMID:17652621, 23296022,19734449). Transcription of the gene can also be silenced in myeloid diseases, leukemias, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer (PMID:25123164, 15327527, 15361843). Methylation of the SOCS1 promoter region has also been used to help define the CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer (PMID:16804544).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8651,"hugoSymbol":"SOCS1","name":"suppressor of cytokine signaling 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000332029","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003745.1","geneAliases":["CISH1","SSI-1","JAB","CIS1","SOCS-1","SSI1","TIP3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23296022","title":"SOCS1 mutation subtypes predict divergent outcomes in diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients.","journal":"Oncotarget","pubDate":"2013 Jan","volume":"4","issue":"1","pages":"35-47","authors":"Schif B et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Schif B et al.
