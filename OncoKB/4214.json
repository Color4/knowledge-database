[{"evidenceId":12237,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MAP3K1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1) gene encodes MEKK1, a kinase that signals in the pro-oncogenic MAP-kinase and JNK signaling pathways. MAP3K1 is unique among the MAPK signaling molecules in that it contains both a kinase domain to phosphorylate downstream MAPK components, and also a PHD domain that acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for ERK1/2, thus allowing for the regulation of pathway output (PMID: 12049732, 25613373). In response to a variety of stimuli such as environmental stress, inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, MAP3K1 undergoes oligomerization and autophosphorylation (PMID: 11784851, 9078260). Activated MAP3K1 phosphorylates MAP2K4/7, MAP2K1/2, and IKK alpha/beta, which then respectively activate the JNK/p38, ERK1/2 and beta-NF-kB pathways (PMID: 7997270, 7624324, 9008162,12471242). Additionally, pro-apoptotic signals such as UV irradiation and DNA damage trigger the cleavage of MAP3K1 by caspase-3, releasing its kinase domain to induce apoptosis (PMID: 10639576, 9528810, 8621725). MAP3K1's role in cancer pathogenesis is context-dependent, where in some instances it functions as a tumor suppressor and in others as a driver of tumorigenesis. Truncating mutations that eliminate the protein's kinase domain, as well as complete MAP3K1 deletions, are frequently identified in breast cancer, predominantly in the luminal A subtype (PMID: 24386504, cBioPortal, MSKCC, May 2015). Conversely, transposon mutagenesis studies in mice provide evidence that MAP3K1 truncated at the N-terminal domain and harboring a constitutively activated kinase domain represents a cancer driver in melanoma (PMID: 24003131). This is consistent with the observation of elevated MAP3K1 expression in human melanoma samples (PMID: 24003131). Moreover, MAP3K1 may play a pro-metastatic role in some cancers, as demonstrated by experimental studies in breast and pancreatic cancer models (PMID: 19513748, 16568086). Germline mutations in MAP3K1 disrupt normal sex development and cause 46,XY sex development disorder (PMID:21129722, 24135036).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-31","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4214,"hugoSymbol":"MAP3K1","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000399503","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005921.1","geneAliases":["MEKK1","MAPKKK1","MEKK","MEKK 1","SRXY6"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24003131","title":"Low-copy piggyBac transposon mutagenesis in mice identifies genes driving melanoma.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2013 Sep 17","volume":"110","issue":"38","pages":"E3640-9","authors":"Ni TK et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.1314435110","link":null,"reference":"Ni TK et al.
