[{"evidenceId":5657,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) is a key regulator of cell apoptosis, and is part of the BCL2 family of proteins that orchestrate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (PMID: 24355989). BCL2 is considered a pro-survival factor that inhibits BAX-mediated mitochondrial permeability, thus preventing cytochrome c release and downstream caspase 9 activation through APAF1 (PMID: 9390557, 9219694, 9390557). BCL2 is commonly linked to the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain locus in follicular B-cell lymphomas via the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (PMID:2875799). This results in robust expression of BCL2 and downstream pro-survival signals, a key step in lymphomagenesis (PMID:7632929). Progression of follicular lymphoma to a more aggressive disease state is often associated with MYC translocation, suggesting a synergy between BCL2 and MYC in cancer progression (PMID:1638027, 12015982). BCL2 is found to be translocated and overexpressed particularly in haematological malignancies, but is infrequently mutated (PMID: 3262202, 16193090). Venetoclax is a small molecule inhibitor of BCL2, and has been approved for treatment in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring a specific genetic alteration (PMID: 26639348).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":596,"hugoSymbol":"BCL2","name":"BCL2, apoptosis regulator","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000333681","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000633.2","geneAliases":["Bcl-2","PPP1R50"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12015982","title":"Suppression of Myc-induced apoptosis in beta cells exposes multiple oncogenic properties of Myc and triggers carcinogenic progression.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"2002 May 3","volume":"109","issue":"3","pages":"321-34","authors":"Pelengaris S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Pelengaris S et al.
