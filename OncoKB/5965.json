The precise mechanisms of action of RECQL are largely unknown, but it is thought to be required for proper DNA replication, DNA repair and genome homeostasis (PMID: 18074021, 20065033, 15886194, 23095637). Alternative functions for RECQL include a role in telomere maintenance (PMID: 24623817). RECQL has been described to regulate genes that promote cell migration and invasion and inhibit apoptosis (PMID: 25424877, 25483193). The RECQL gene is rarely altered in tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).
