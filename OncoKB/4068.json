[{"evidenceId":18148,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"SH2D1A encodes a SH2 domain containing adaptor protein that binds to the lymphocyte cell surface protein Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule (SLAM) (PMID: 9774102). SLAM receptors are expressed on hematopoietic cells and regulate lymphocyte activity (PMID: 18031694). SH2D1A competes with the recruitment of signaling molecules such as SHP-2 phosphatase and also functions as a scaffold to recruit FynT kinase (PMID: 12458214). It is involved in the regulation and development of B-cells, NK cells, and T-cells including humoral immunity, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity (PMID: 15711562, 20153220, 15774582, 12529646). Mutation of SH2D1A is associated with X-linked immune dysfunction, susceptibility to EBV infection, and lymphoproliferative disease (PMID: 9771704). X-linked lymphoproliferative disease patients can also develop hemophagocytosis, lymphomas, and cytopenias (PMID: 11049992, 20926771). Mutations have been identified in lymphomas (PMID: 23589280).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4068,"hugoSymbol":"SH2D1A","name":"SH2 domain containing 1A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000371139","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002351.4","geneAliases":["XLPD","LYP","XLPD1","SAP","DSHP","IMD5","SAP/SH2D1A","EBVS","XLP"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9774102","title":"The X-linked lymphoproliferative-disease gene product SAP regulates signals induced through the co-receptor SLAM.","journal":"Nature","pubDate":"1998 Oct 1","volume":"395","issue":"6701","pages":"462-9","authors":"Sayos J et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Sayos J et al.
