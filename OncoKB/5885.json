[{"evidenceId":13770,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RAD21 encodes the protein subunit RAD21, a member of the cohesin complex. Cohesin is a tripartitie ring that aligns and stabilizes sister chromatids during metaphase. The cohesin ring is comprised of 2 large structural proteins, SMC1a and SMC3, which heterodimerize. The ring opens and closes through the binding of the alpha-klesin subunits to the RAD21 adapter protein. Loss of function mutations in RAD21 and other cohesin complex mutations do not appear to increase the frequency of aneuploidy or large chromosomal breaks in myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 25006131), although there is controversy as to whether other cohesin complex family mutations in solid tumors may result in an increase in cytogenetic abnormalities (PMID: 25867412, 24121791).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-13","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5885,"hugoSymbol":"RAD21","name":"RAD21 cohesin complex component","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000297338","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006265.2","geneAliases":["HRAD21","MCD1","HR21","SCC1","hHR21","CDLS4","NXP1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25867412","title":"Loss of STAG2 causes aneuploidy in normal human bladder cells.","journal":"Genetics and molecular research : GMR","pubDate":"2015 Mar 30","volume":"14","issue":"1","pages":"2638-46","authors":"Li X et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.4238/2015.March.30.24","link":null,"reference":"Li X et al.
