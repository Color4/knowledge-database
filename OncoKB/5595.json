[{"evidenceId":19724,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"MAPK3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, also known as ERK1) is a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase considered an effector kinase in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. This pathway is triggered by mitosis and differentiation factors as well as cytokines, resulting in MEK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of MAPK3, which induces its homodimerization and translocation to the nucleus where it phosphorylates target proteins (PMID: 9604935, 9166761, 17496918). MAPK3 targets include cytoskeletal molecules and nucleoporins, but foremost kinases and transcription factors with central roles in cell proliferation and survival, including include RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) and MSK ( mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases), MYC, c-FOS, ELK-1, ETS-1 and MITF (PMID: 25320010, 22569528). MAPK3 and its homolog, MAPK1 (ERK2), are essential for cell proliferation; they are ubiquitously and often simultaneously expressed, but evidence suggests they may have some distinct functions in specialized contexts (PMID: 23482492, 21248139, 17496918). MAPK3 is mutated at low frequency in various types of cancers. Inhibitors of MAPK1/3 are being explored as complementary and alternative options to RAF and MEK inhibition in cases of resistance or partial response (PMID: 25435214).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-10","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5595,"hugoSymbol":"MAPK3","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263025","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002746.2","geneAliases":["ERK-1","P44MAPK","PRKM3","ERK1","HUMKER1A","HS44KDAP","P44ERK1","ERT2","p44-MAPK","p44-ERK1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21248139","title":"Deletion of ERK1 and ERK2 in the CNS causes cortical abnormalities and neonatal lethality: Erk1 deficiency enhances the impairment of neurogenesis in Erk2-deficient mice.","journal":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","pubDate":"2011 Jan 19","volume":"31","issue":"3","pages":"1149-55","authors":"Satoh Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2243-10.2011","link":null,"reference":"Satoh Y et al.
