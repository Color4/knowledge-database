[{"evidenceId":5509,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ETV1 (ETS Translocation Variant 1) gene, belongs to the ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors. The downstream transcriptional targets of ETV1 are diverse and tissue specific. ETV1 is a downstream transcriptional mediator of the MAP kinase pathway and it is tightly regulated by the MAP kinase through transcription, protein stability, and phosphorylation (PMID: 12213813, 19251651, 20927104). The endogenous expression of ETV1 is restricted to several tissues, including specific neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems (PMID: 16289830, 21746923, 10850491) and the interstitial cells of Cajal (“pacemaker” cells of the gastrointestinal tract) (PMID: 20927104). ETV1 is aberrantly activated in several cancers through distinct mechanisms: In Ewing sarcoma, ETV1 is fused with the EWS protein to generate the chimeric EWS-ETV1 protein. In prostate cancer, ETV1 is aberrantly over-expressed through translocation resulting in either fusion transcript or full-length transcript. In melanoma, ETV1 is aberrantly over-expressed through genetic amplification of its chromosomal locus. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), ETV1 is endogenously highly expressed and required to maintain lineage specification and survival (PMID: 7700648, 17671502, 20160028, 20927104).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2115,"hugoSymbol":"ETV1","name":"ETS variant 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000405192","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001163147.1","geneAliases":["ER81"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19251651","title":"(V600E)BRAF is associated with disabled feedback inhibition of RAF-MEK signaling and elevated transcriptional output of the pathway.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pubDate":"2009 Mar 17","volume":"106","issue":"11","pages":"4519-24","authors":"Pratilas CA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1073/pnas.0900780106","link":null,"reference":"Pratilas CA et al.
