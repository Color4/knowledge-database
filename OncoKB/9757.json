[{"evidenceId":17668,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"KMT2B encodes the histone methyltransferase MLL4, an epigenetic modulator that methylates lysine residue 4 on the tail of histone H3 (H3K4). Methylation of H3K4 leads to increased genome accessibility, recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and activation of gene expression (PMID: 25998713). KMT2B methylates H3K4 at enhancer regions, leading to increased expression of target genes and changes in chromatin looping structures (PMID: 25998713, 28759003, 24368734). KMT2B plays a role in regulating cell cycle progression and cell viability and induces transcription of leukemic genes (PMID: 22713656). Unlike other KMT2 homolog genes, KMT2B is mutated at low frequencies in cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Oct 2017).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9757,"hugoSymbol":"KMT2B","name":"lysine methyltransferase 2B","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000222270","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014727.1","geneAliases":["MLL4","HRX2","WBP-7","CXXC10","WBP7","MLL1B","TRX2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24368734","title":"H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase MLL4 is required for enhancer activation during cell differentiation.","journal":"eLife","pubDate":"2013 Dec 24","volume":"2","issue":"","pages":"e01503","authors":"Lee JE et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.7554/eLife.01503","link":null,"reference":"Lee JE et al. eLife. 2013 Dec 24;2()e01503.","abstract":null},{"pmid":"28759003","title":"MLL4 prepares the enhancer landscape for Foxp3 induction via chromatin looping.","journal":"Nature immunology","pubDate":"2017 Sep","volume":"18","issue":"9","pages":"1035-1045","authors":"Placek K et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ni.3812","link":null,"reference":"Placek K et al.
