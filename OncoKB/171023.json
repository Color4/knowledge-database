[{"evidenceId":6026,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"ASXL1 is a member of the Polycomb group of proteins, and is a chromatin binder that is involved in transcription regulation. ASXL1 is a member of the ASXL gene family that includes ASXL1, ASXL2 and ASXL3, which all have a C-terminal plant homology domain (PHD domain) that is predicted to recognize histone H3 tails via methylated lysines (PMID: 23147254). ASXL1 interacts directly with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and has a role in the recruitment of PRC2 to chromatin and subsequent H3K27me3 histone modifications (PMID: 22897849). Mutations in ASXL1 result in the inability of Polycomb target genes to be effectively repressed leading to dysregulated gene expression, such as at the HOXA gene cluster (PMID: 22897849). ASXL1 also independently interacts with the chromatin protein BAP1 (PMID: 22878500). The BAP1-ASXL1 complex can regulate the H2AK119 ubiquitin mark placed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) (PMID: 20436459). Germline heterozygous mutations in ASXL1 have been found in patients with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a developmental disorder that results in distinctive craniofacial abnormalities (PMID: 21706002). Recurrent somatic ASXL1 loss-of-function mutations are very common in hematopoietic malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelofibrosis (MF), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 23147254). Furthermore, ASXL1 mutations frequently co-occur with N/K-Ras mutations in CMML to promote leukemogenesis (PMID: 21455215).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":171023,"hugoSymbol":"ASXL1","name":"additional sex combs like 1, transcriptional regulator","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000375687","curatedRefSeq":"NM_015338.5","geneAliases":["MDS","BOPS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22897849","title":"ASXL1 mutations promote myeloid transformation through loss of PRC2-mediated gene repression.","journal":"Cancer cell","pubDate":"2012 Aug 14","volume":"22","issue":"2","pages":"180-93","authors":"Abdel-Wahab O et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2012.06.032","link":null,"reference":"Abdel-Wahab O et al.
