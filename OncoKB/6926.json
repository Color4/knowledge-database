[{"evidenceId":18547,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"TBX3 encodes the T-box3 transcription factor that is involved in multiple stages of development (PMID:25294936). It binds DNA using the T-box domain and mediates transcriptional repression (PMID:10468588). It plays an important part in embryonic patterning, stem cell specification, and organ system development including the cardiac conduction system, mammary gland, and liver (PMID: 24319661, 15158141,12668638, 18356246, 19571885, 20139965). It also is involved in regulating pluripotency in stem cells (PMID: 20139965). Germline mutations result in the ulnar-mammary syndrome resulting in defects of the limb, apocrine gland, tooth and genital systems (PMID: 9207801). It is expressed in various cancer types and has been implicated in cell survival, interactions with the TP53 pathway, and invasiveness (PMID:17283120,16222716,18245468,18829543, 24316392). Mutations have been identified in breast cancer (PMID:22722201, 26451490, 26249178).
