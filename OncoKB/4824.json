[{"evidenceId":18665,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"NKX3-1 (NK3 homeobox 1, also known as NKX3.1) is a homeobox-contiaing transcription factor and prostate-specific tumor suppressor that is under tight androgenic control (PMID: 11839815, 19886863, 11085535, 9226374). NKX3-1 is expressed at high levels in the prostate where it plays a role in tissue differentiation and homeostasis (PMID: 11839815, 8943214, 10215624), and is proposed to be a marker of prostate-specific stem cells (PMID: 19741607). Loss of heterozygosity of the 8p21 genomic locus, which includes NKX3-1, is associated with tissue dedifferentiation and lost of androgen response in prostate cancer (PMID: 9226374). Loss of NKX3-1 expression is found in prostate tumors of different stages, from benign prostate hyperplasia to castrate-resistant and metastatic prostate cancer (PMID: 11085535, TCGA PRAD paper, no PMID yet).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4824,"hugoSymbol":"NKX3-1","name":"NK3 homeobox 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000380871","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006167.3","geneAliases":["NKX3A","NKX3.1","BAPX2","NKX3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11839815","title":"Conditional loss of Nkx3.1 in adult mice induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","pubDate":"2002 Mar","volume":"22","issue":"5","pages":"1495-503","authors":"Abdulkadir SA et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Abdulkadir SA et al.
