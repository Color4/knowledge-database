TCF3 expression is essential for lymphopoiesis, and B and T lymphocyte development. It has been shown to play a role in repressing Wnt signaling, specifically beta-catenin expression, during neuronal differentiation and proliferation of neural precursor cells (PMID 24832538, 21730189). Together with p53, TCF3 enforces p21 expression and cell-cycle arrest in response to genotoxic stress (PMID: 23684607). Its deletions or diminished protein activity have been associated with several lymphoid malignancies, including pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukuemia, childhood leukemia and acute leukemia (PMID: 12700034). The TCF3 locus is a common target of chromosome rearrangements in diverse leukemias, leading to E2A chimeric proteins (PMID: 17311319, 17593026, 11588043, 11243406).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6929,"hugoSymbol":"TCF3","name":"transcription factor 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000344749","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001136139.2","geneAliases":["TCF-3","ITF1","E2A","E47","AGM8","VDIR","bHLHb21"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"17311319","title":"Molecular cytogenetic characterization of TCF3 (E2A)/19p13.3 rearrangements in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","journal":"Genes, chromosomes &amp; cancer","pubDate":"2007 May","volume":"46","issue":"5","pages":"478-86","authors":"Barber KE et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Barber KE et al.
