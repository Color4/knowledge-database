[{"evidenceId":18623,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"SHQ1 (SHQ1, H/ACA ribonucleoprotein assembly factor) is located on chromosome 3p13. SHQ1 is suggested to function in rRNA processing and has been shown to be involved in the formation of a protein-RNA complex (snoRNP [small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein]) known as the H/ACA box (PMID: 19383767, 12228251). The H/ACA box is involved in processing of rRNA, modifications of species of RNAs, and stabilization of telomeres (PMID: 20227365, 19383767). SHQ1 are shown to bind NAP57, which is an essential member of H/ACA, prior to the binding of another accessory protein, NAF1, and is thought to assist in the shuttling of the complex to nucleoli (PMID: 20227365, 19383767). SHQ1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain known as the CS domain (named after CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1) which appears to be essential for H/ACA complex formation (PMID: 19426738, 19019820). The genetic locus of SHQ1 is frequently deleted in prostate cancers and one somatic mutations has been observed (PMID: 20579941).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":55164,"hugoSymbol":"SHQ1","name":"SHQ1, H/ACA ribonucleoprotein assembly factor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000325599","curatedRefSeq":"NM_018130.2","geneAliases":["Shq1p","GRIM-1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"12228251","title":"The Shq1p.Naf1p complex is required for box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle biogenesis.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"2002 Nov 22","volume":"277","issue":"47","pages":"45235-42","authors":"Yang PK et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Yang PK et al.
