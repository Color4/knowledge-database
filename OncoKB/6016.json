These proteins function as binary molecular switches; in response to external stimuli, they exchange GDP with GTP, thereby triggering several intracellular signaling networks. RIT1 is widely expressed in adult and embryonic tissue, including primary neurons and the developing brain. It plays a central role in the induction of neuronal differentiation through activation of both the BRAF/ERK and the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways (PMID: 15632082, 11914372). Additionally, RIT1 plays a role in regulating axonal versus dendritic growth, and it contributes to IFNγ-induced dendritic retraction (PMID: 17460085, 12668729, 18957053). RIT1 has been identified as a regulator of a p38/MAPK-dependent cascade that functions as a prosurvival mechanism in response to oxidative stress (PMID: 21737674, 21444726, 23123784). RIT1 gain-of-function mutations are associated with Noonan syndrome (PMID: 25049390, 24939608, 23791108); activating mutations in the Switch II domain of RIT1 have been observed in lung adenocarcinoma and myeloid malignancies (PMID: 25079552, 24469055, 23765226). The transforming potential of RIT1 is associated with the activation of a p38γ-dependent signaling pathway (PMID: 11821041, 15831491).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-10","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6016,"hugoSymbol":"RIT1","name":"Ras like without CAAX 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000368323","curatedRefSeq":"NM_006912.5","geneAliases":["RIBB","NS8","RIT","ROC1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"18957053","title":"Rit signaling contributes to interferon-gamma-induced dendritic retraction via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.","journal":"Journal of neurochemistry","pubDate":"2008 Dec","volume":"107","issue":"5","pages":"1436-47","authors":"Andres DA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05708.x","link":null,"reference":"Andres DA et al.
