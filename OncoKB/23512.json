SUZ12 is necessary for both the histone methyltransferase activity and silencing function of PRC2 (PMID: 15225548), which are important in regulating development and expression of cell identity genes, including the HOX cluster of genes (PMID: 16625203). SUZ12 is commonly mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 25240281, 22237151, 22237106, 23486531). Translocations involving SUZ12 have been identified in endometrial stromal tumors (PMID: 11371647). Mutations in SUZ12 can cooperate with Ras pathway signaling in cellular transformation and may sensitize tumor cells to bromodomain inhibitors (PMID: 25119042).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":23512,"hugoSymbol":"SUZ12","name":"SUZ12 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000322652","curatedRefSeq":"NM_015355.2","geneAliases":["CHET9","JJAZ1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22237151","title":"Genetic inactivation of the polycomb repressive complex 2 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","journal":"Nature medicine","pubDate":"2012 Feb 6","volume":"18","issue":"2","pages":"298-301","authors":"Ntziachristos P et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/nm.2651","link":null,"reference":"Ntziachristos P et al.
