[{"evidenceId":19165,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"FH (fumarate hydratase, also known as fumarase) encodes an enzyme that converts fumarate to malate as part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. FH exists in a mitochondrial and a cytosolic form, the former of which carries out FH's canonical role in the TCA cycle and the latter of which is likely involved in amino acid metabolism (PMID: 23643539, 14708972). The mitochondrial form of FH is determined by a C-terminal signal sequence (PMID: 18577574). Heterozygous germline mutations of FH cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple cutaneous piloleiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas and papillary type 2 renal cancer (PMID: 20618355, 11865300, 15937070, 12772087, 16155190). Individuals with this disease are at risk for developing cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, a form kidney cancer (PMID: 19470762). In HLRCC, tumor formation occurs following the inactivation of the wildtype allele, and therefore FH is classified as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 16155190, 20618355). Somatic FH mutations are sporadically found in other cancer types. The mechanism underlying FH-deficient disease is attributed to reduced or ablated FH enzymatic activity (PMID: 12761039, 14708972).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2271,"hugoSymbol":"FH","name":"fumarate hydratase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000366560","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000143.3","geneAliases":["HLRCC","LRCC","MCL","MCUL1","FMRD"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"18577574","title":"The mitochondrial targeting sequence tilts the balance between mitochondrial and cytosolic dual localization.","journal":"Journal of cell science","pubDate":"2008 Jul 15","volume":"121","issue":"Pt 14","pages":"2423-31","authors":"Regev-Rudzki N et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1242/jcs.029207","link":null,"reference":"Regev-Rudzki N et al.
