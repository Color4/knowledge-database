It is a target of the BCR-ABL translocation kinase and enhances transformation in CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia) (PMID:20807813). CRKL can activate the Ras, Rac, and Jun kinase signaling pathways (PMID:12393632, 11443118, 10514505). Pathway activation mediates diverse cellular processes involved in cancer including cell proliferation, EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition), and invasion (PMID:26044596, 25661331,25318601). CRKL amplification has been identified in lung carcinomas and gastric cancer (PMID:22591714, 22586683). Amplification can be a means of acquired resistance to targeted therapy in EGFR lung cancer (PMID:22586683).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1399,"hugoSymbol":"CRKL","name":"CRK like proto-oncogene, adaptor protein","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000354336","curatedRefSeq":"NM_005207.3","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11443118","title":"CrkL is recruited through its SH2 domain to the erythropoietin receptor and plays a role in Lyn-mediated receptor signaling.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"2001 Aug 31","volume":"276","issue":"35","pages":"33282-90","authors":"Arai A et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Arai A et al.
