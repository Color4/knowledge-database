[{"evidenceId":9247,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds ligands of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family and transmits intracellular signals via the pro-oncogenic mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (PMID: 24561444). RET is normally expressed in the developing embryo, playing a particularly important role in neural and neuroendocrine lineages (PMID: 8306871). In cancer, RET can be activated either through point mutations or gene rearrangements with a variety of translocation partners resulting in constitutively active cytosolic oncoproteins (PMID: 24561444). Heritable activating mutations in RET lead to the highly penetrant familial cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, multiple mucosal neuromas and intestinal ganglioneuromas, marfanoid habitus) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) (PMID: 15322516). Oncogenic somatic mutations include point mutations and genomic rearrangements of the RET locus leading to inversions or translocations. These have been identified in various cancers including papillary thyroid cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In addition, aberrant expression or activation of wildtype RET correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer and endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer (PMID: 24561444).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-10","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5979,"hugoSymbol":"RET","name":"ret proto-oncogene","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000355710","curatedRefSeq":"NM_020975.4","geneAliases":["MTC1","CDHF12","CDHR16","MEN2A","RET51","HSCR1","MEN2B","PTC","RET-ELE1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"15322516","title":"Highly penetrant hereditary cancer syndromes.","journal":"Oncogene","pubDate":"2004 Aug 23","volume":"23","issue":"38","pages":"6445-70","authors":"Nagy R et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Nagy R et al.
