[{"evidenceId":5002,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"IGF1 encodes insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) which is a peptide hormone that signals through the Igf1 receptor (Igf1R) and the insulin receptor (IR), albeit with low affinity to the latter. The main function of Igf1 is to stimulate growth in a wide array of tissues. IGF1 is broadly expressed however the liver produces the majority of circulating Igf1 in response to GH secreted by the pituitary. Circulating Igf1 is bound to Igf-binding proteins (IGFBPs), e.g. IGFBP3, and only the free Igf1 is biologically active. In epidemiologic studies, high circulating levels of Igf1 and low levels of IGFBP3 have been associated with breast, prostate, colon, lung, and genitourinary cancers (PMID: 9593409, 9365156, 9438850, 10203281, 9923856). Genetic variation in the 3-prime region of the IGF1 gene may contribute to increased circulating Igf1 levels (PubMed: 17911177). Tissues can regulate levels of Igf1R and IGFBPs to modify Igf1 signaling and alterations in this local control may result in cancer (PMID: 23569026).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3479,"hugoSymbol":"IGF1","name":"insulin like growth factor 1","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000307046","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001111285.1","geneAliases":["IGF-I","IGFI","MGF"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"9438850","title":"Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I and prostate cancer risk: a prospective study.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"1998 Jan 23","volume":"279","issue":"5350","pages":"563-6","authors":"Chan JM et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Chan JM et al.
