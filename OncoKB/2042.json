EPHA3 is highly expressed during embryonic development (PMID: 10197531, 9883737, 25391995) and is overexpressed in various cancer types, including sarcoma, leukemia, glioblastoma and hepatocellular cancer (PMID: 25391995, 23410976, 28415715, 2792259 ). EPHA3 loss-of-function mutations have been identified in various cancer types including lung cancer, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers resulting in decreased EPHA3 signaling and enhanced cellular proliferation (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Sept. 2017) (PMID: 22829656, 22242939).
