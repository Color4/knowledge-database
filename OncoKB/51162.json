It is a secreted factor expressed in the endothelium during embryonic and neonatal development and has a proposed role in vasculogenesis and neural stem-cell renewal (PMID: 15085134, 19503073, 15085134, 22160377). EGFL7 expression has also been detected in adult human tissues (PMID: 18556249). Its role in cancer is unclear, but its ability to modulate angiogenesis and immune responses has been proposed to influence tumorigenesis (PMID: 22037871) . Elevated expression of EGFL7 has been found in human tumors, including glioma, hepatocellular carcinomas, breast cancer and suggesting a potential role as biomarker (PMID: 19503073, 19824075, 26328008, 23558933, 23404186).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":51162,"hugoSymbol":"EGFL7","name":"EGF like domain multiple 7","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000308874","curatedRefSeq":"NM_201446.2","geneAliases":["VE-STATIN","ZNEU1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22037871","title":"Egfl7 promotes tumor escape from immunity by repressing endothelial cell activation.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2011 Dec 1","volume":"71","issue":"23","pages":"7176-86","authors":"Delfortrie S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1301","link":null,"reference":"Delfortrie S et al.
