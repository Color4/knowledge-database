[{"evidenceId":18694,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The RAC1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) gene encodes a member of the Rho family of GTPases, which includes RHO, RAC1 and CDC42. Rho GTPases regulate the assembly and disassembly of the cytoskeleton; in this regard, RAC1 plays a role in cell adhesion, differentiation and migration (PMID: 24072884, 17373658). Additionally, RAC1 is involved in pathways governing proliferation (MAPK pathway), the inflammatory response (NFkB pathway) and regulation of the cell cycle (PMID: 24072884, 10816416, 17373658). The activity of RAC1 is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which switch GDP for GTP and trigger catalysis of GTP to GDP, respectively (PMID: 10816416). RAC1 is ubiquitously expressed, and gain-of-function mutations are implicated in processes underlying metastasis and drug-resistance; therefore, RAC1 is a putative drug target (PMID: 22407364, 25056119, 19509242, 24072884, 25594058, 24750242). RAC1 mutations are found predominantly in melanoma, but have also been identified in other cancer types (PMID: 22817889, 22842228, 17904119, 22786680). An alternatively spliced and constitutively active version of RAC1, named RAC1B, has been detected in colon and lung cancer (PMID: 11062023, 10597294, 15516977, 22786680).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5879,"hugoSymbol":"RAC1","name":"ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (rho family, small GTP binding protein Rac1)","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000356142","curatedRefSeq":"NM_018890.3","geneAliases":["p21-Rac1","Rac-1","MIG5","TC-25"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25056119","title":"The RAC1 P29S hotspot mutation in melanoma confers resistance to pharmacological inhibition of RAF.","journal":"Cancer research","pubDate":"2014 Sep 1","volume":"74","issue":"17","pages":"4845-4852","authors":"Watson IR et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1232-T","link":null,"reference":"Watson IR et al.
