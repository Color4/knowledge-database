[{"evidenceId":19252,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The HLA-A (Human Leukocyte Antigen A) gene encodes for the heavy chain subunit of the Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) complex. A critical component of the immune system is the presentation of foreign antigens on the cell surface by the MHC molecules (PMID: 10974135). Tumor cells are vulnerable to such an immune response due to the presentation of tumor-specific antigens such as mutated oncoproteins on the cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435). Several types of tumors are known to evade such an immunological response by crippling the levels of MHC I-presenting antigens on tumor cell surfaces (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435, 11665717). The HLA-A genes encode for the heavy chain subunit of the MHC (PMID: 22434516). In many tumors a reduction in HLA-A levels is seen which may be due to factors like genomic alteration, transcriptional regulation, protein transportation, and oncogene regulation (PMID: 24244023, 11665717). Genomic alterations are observed only rarely: e.g. chromosomal loss resulting in loss of the HLA locus is observed in 13.8% of colon tumors, 17.6% of laryngeal tumors, 15.3% of melanoma tumors and 17.2% of epithelial squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 9057360). In HCT116 colorectal cancer cells HLA-A1 and HLA-A2 are down regulated by DNA methylation and by the action of the MEK pathway (PMID: 19569244). Similarly, gastric and esophageal cancers also display HLA-A downregulation via action of RAS, MYC and the HER2 oncogene, as well as the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (PMID: 24244023, 20715101, 20628381). A major implication from a therapeutic standpoint is to target immunotherapy at patients whose cancers display an evasion of the immune system via HLA-A reduction (PMID: 9057360, 24782321, 23157435).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-06","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3105,"hugoSymbol":"HLA-A","name":"major histocompatibility complex, class I, A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000376809","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001242758.1","geneAliases":["HLAA","HLA-A11","HLA-A33","Aw-33","Aw-74"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24244023","title":"The MAPK pathway is a predominant regulator of HLA-A expression in esophageal and gastric cancer.","journal":"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","pubDate":"2013 Dec 15","volume":"191","issue":"12","pages":"6261-72","authors":"Mimura K et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1301597","link":null,"reference":"Mimura K et al.
