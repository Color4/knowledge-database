Histone molecules allow for the effective packaging of DNA in the nucleus and are built out of nucleosomes assembled from histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (PMID: 11498575). Histone variants, such as H3.5, are highly conserved compared to the canonical histone protein differing by only a few amino acids. H3F3C is highly expressed in the testes and binds near transcription start sites, implicating H3F3C in transcriptional activation (PMID: 26779285).
