GPS2 interacts with transcription factors, nuclear receptors and histone acetyltransferases, thereby regulating transcriptional repression and activation (PMID: 11931768, 11486030, 17895379, 19481530, 24953653, 18218630, 10846067). GPS2 is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to both the nucleus, where it acts as a modulator of transcription, and the cytoplasm, where it modulates proinflammatory TNFα signaling and JNK activity (PMID: 22424771, 19858209, 11486030, 16122992, 20159957). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in GPS2 are found in medulloblastoma and are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that GPS2 functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 22820256, 25030029). Translocations have also been observed in glioblastoma multiforme and undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma (PMID: 23917401, 25139254).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-19","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2874,"hugoSymbol":"GPS2","name":"G protein pathway suppressor 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000380728","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004489.4","geneAliases":["AMF-1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25030029","title":"Mutation and expression analysis in medulloblastoma yields prognostic variants and a putative mechanism of disease for i17q tumors.","journal":"Acta neuropathologica communications","pubDate":"2014 Jul 17","volume":"2","issue":"","pages":"74","authors":"Bien-Willner GA et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1186/s40478-014-0074-1","link":null,"reference":"Bien-Willner GA et al.
