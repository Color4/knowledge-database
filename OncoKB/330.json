It is a modulator of NFκB activity and an inhibitor of apoptosis, containing a caspase-recruiting domain (CARD), commonly found in apoptotic factors, and a RING finger domain which allows for ligation of ubiquitin to substrates of BIRC3 (PMID: 8548810, 20651737). BIRC3 activates the canonical NFκB pathway following tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α binding to TNFR1 (TNF receptor 1). Receptor activation triggers assembly of a complex wherein BIRC3 mediates ubiquitination of RIPK1 (Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1) and other factors, resulting in derepression of NFκB (PMID: 20651737, 11907583). BIRC3 also activates non-canonical NFκB signaling by mediating ubiquitination of NIK (NF­κB-­inducing kinase) (PMID: 20651737, 11907583). Additionally, BIRC3 is proposed to directly ubiquitinate caspases 3 and 7 (PMID: 20651737). BIRC3 and its homolog, BIRC2 (cIAP1), are functionally redundant in preclinical model systems, but also have non-overlapping expression patterns suggesting distinct biological functions (PMID: 20651737, 21430708). BIRC3 is infrequently mutated in human cancers but is amplified in some lung cancers (PMID: 12651874).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-11","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":330,"hugoSymbol":"BIRC3","name":"baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000263464","curatedRefSeq":"NM_182962.2","geneAliases":["MIHC","HAIP1","API2","AIP1","RNF49","c-IAP2","HIAP1","MALT2","CIAP2"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19464198","title":"Cellular inhibitors of apoptosis cIAP1 and cIAP2 are required for innate immunity signaling by the pattern recognition receptors NOD1 and NOD2.","journal":"Immunity","pubDate":"2009 Jun 19","volume":"30","issue":"6","pages":"789-801","authors":"Bertrand MJ et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2009.04.011","link":null,"reference":"Bertrand MJ et al.
