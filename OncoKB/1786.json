The N-terminal contains a nuclear localization domain (PMID: 10508852), a replication foci targeting domain (PMID: 1423634), and autoregulatory cysteine-rich CXXC and bromo-adjacent homology domains that recognize unmethylated DNA and inhibit catalysis to prevent de novo methylation (PMID: 21163962). The catalytic C-terminal transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the 5 position of cytosine to produce 5-methylcytosine and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. UHRF1 recruits DNMT1 to hemimethylated DNA for proper function (PMID: 17673620, 17994007) but also targets DNMT1 for degradation by ubiquitination (PMID: 21045206). DNMT1 plays an important role in a number of physiologic processes such as X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, chromosomal stability, and repression of retrotransposon expression. DNMT1 mutations are rarely (1%) found in cancer, and most (68%) are missense substitutions of unknown significance; however, DNMT1 overexpression has been observed in colon cancer (PMID: 2014266, PMID: 10463569), gastric cancer (PMID: 14742272), breast cancer (PMID: 14555514), bladder cancer (PMID: 14634451), and acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia (PMID: 11222358).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":1786,"hugoSymbol":"DNMT1","name":"DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000340748","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001379.2","geneAliases":["CXXC9","DNMT","ADCADN","AIM","MCMT","HSN1E","m.HsaI"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21163962","title":"Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","pubDate":"2011 Feb 25","volume":"331","issue":"6020","pages":"1036-40","authors":"Song J et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1126/science.1195380","link":null,"reference":"Song J et al.
