In addition, DICER1 loads siRNA onto the Argonaute protein and mediates the binding of co-factors to initiate RNA-induced silencing (PMID: 25176334). In this way, DICER1 plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (PMID: 25176334). Germline mutations in DICER1 are associated with DICER1-related disorders, a familial tumor susceptibility syndrome that confers increased risk most commonly for pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), cystic nephroma (CN), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), multinodular goiter, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor and other neoplastic condition (PMID: 19556464, 21266384, 21882293, 24761742). The majority of germline mutations in DICER1 are nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations leading to premature protein truncation and loss of protein function (PMID: 21266384, 19556464, 25176334). Somatic DICER1 mutations have also been identified, predominantly affecting the region of the protein that mediates the interaction of DICER1 with miRNAs (PMID: 25176334). DICER1 has been identified as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 19903759, 20019750), as monoallelic but biallelic loss of DICER1 causes tumor formation. Consistent with the role of DICER1 as a tumor suppressor, reduced expression of DICER1 correlates with a poor outcome in lung, breast, skin, endometrial and ovarian cancer (PMID: 15723655, 19092150, 19782670, 20210522, 20832293).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-09-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":23405,"hugoSymbol":"DICER1","name":"dicer 1, ribonuclease III","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000343455","curatedRefSeq":"NM_030621.3","geneAliases":["DCR1","RMSE2","K12H4.8-LIKE","Dicer","Dicer1e","HERNA","MNG1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19092150","title":"Dicer, Drosha, and outcomes in patients with ovarian cancer.","journal":"The New England journal of medicine","pubDate":"2008 Dec 18","volume":"359","issue":"25","pages":"2641-50","authors":"Merritt WM et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0803785","link":null,"reference":"Merritt WM et al.
