SPOP contains a nuclear localization sequence, a BTB (Bric-a-brac/Tramtrack/Broad complex) domain that mediates dimerization and interaction with CUL3, and a MATH domain that recognizes substrates for ubiquitination (PMID: 19818708). The repertoire of SPOP substrates is not well characterized; however, notable proteins include SRC3, DAXX, H2AFY, AR, BMI1, DEK, ESR1 and TRIM24 (PMID: 25278611, 15897469, 25274033, 21577200, 25766326). Point mutations in SPOP are reported in approximately 5% of endometrial cancers (PMID: 23104009) and 10% of prostate cancers (PMID: 21307934, 22610119). SPOP mutations in both endometrial and prostate cancer cluster in conserved residues of the MATH domain, suggesting that the mutations either alter substrate recognition or act as a dominant negative to prevent substrate degradation. Interestingly, the mutations found in endometrial cancer do not overlap with mutations found in prostate cancer, suggesting that they may have distinct functions. SPOP mutations in prostate cancer are always missense, heterozygous and the wildtype allele is always expressed, suggesting that it may have a gain-of-function or dominant negative function. In contrast, some SPOP mutations in endometrial cancer are associated with loss of the wild-type allele, while others are frame-shift or nonsense mutations, suggesting that they are inactivating. There is emerging evidence that SPOP may be a more general tumor suppressor in glioblastoma, gastric and colorectal cancers, as SPOP expression is decreased through tumor progression (PMID: 25351530, 23216165). However, more definitive evidence such as mutations or copy number loss is not observed in these tumor types.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-22","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":8405,"hugoSymbol":"SPOP","name":"speckle type BTB/POZ protein","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000347630","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001007228.1","geneAliases":["TEF2","BTBD32"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25278611","title":"Prostate cancer.
