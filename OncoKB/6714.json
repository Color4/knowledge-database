Furthermore, c-SRC has been strongly correlated with a variety of human malignancies including colorectal and breast cancer among others (PMID:19581523). The c-SRC protein consists of a N-terminal myristolation sequence, important for membrane localization and subsequent functionality, followed by an unique SH4 domain, a SH3 domain, a SH2 domain, a linker to the protein-tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (PMID: 8672527). c-SRC is closely related to nine additional non-receptor tyrosine kinases that share homology with c-SRC, the SRC Family Kinases (SFK), which exert similar functions and are also implicated in human cancers (PMID: 25207369, 24948875, 24574860, 24522479, 24388104, 24361441).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6714,"hugoSymbol":"SRC","name":"SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000358208","curatedRefSeq":"NM_198291.2","geneAliases":["THC6","c-SRC","ASV","p60-Src","SRC1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25207369","title":"Molecular biology of basal and squamous cell carcinomas.","journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","pubDate":"2014","volume":"810","issue":"","pages":"234-52","authors":"Emmert S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Emmert S et al.
