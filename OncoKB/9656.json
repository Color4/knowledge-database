MDC1 binds to sites of DNA double-stranded breaks through its SDT domain, which binds to the MRN complex, and its BRCT domain which binds to phospho-H2AX (PMID: 16377563, 11741547, 16618811, 15201865). The main functions of MDC1 are to regulate the cell cycle check points in S and G2/M phase through Chk1/2 and to regulate TP53 apoptotic response to DNA damage (PMID: 12607005, 11100718, 12607004, 12607003, 16427009). MDC1 binds TP53 through its BRC1 domain which inhibits TP53 transactivation domain (PMID: 17535811, 24194938). Loss of MDC1 results in genomic instability and promotes oncogenesis in a variety of cancer entities (PMID: 17546051). In some cancers, however, oncogenic functions of MDC1 have been observed (PMID: 21853275).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":9656,"hugoSymbol":"MDC1","name":"mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000376406","curatedRefSeq":"NM_014641.2","geneAliases":["NFBD1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"21853275","title":"NFBD1/MDC1 is a protein of oncogenic potential in human cervical cancer.","journal":"Molecular and cellular biochemistry","pubDate":"2012 Jan","volume":"359","issue":"1-2","pages":"333-46","authors":"Yuan C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1007/s11010-011-1027-7","link":null,"reference":"Yuan C et al.
