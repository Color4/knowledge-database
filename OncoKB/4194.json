The two major negative regulators of p53, MDM2 and MDM4, function by blocking its N-terminal transactivation domain (PMID: 21730163). In addition, MDM4 stimulates the MDM2-catalysed ubiquitination of p53 which leads to its degradation (PMID: 14507994, 12162806). Similar to MDM2, MDM4 is deregulated in several tumor types such as cutaneous melanoma, primary breast tumors, retinoblastomas (PMID: 17080083), Ewing sarcomas (PMID: 21098696) and gliomas (PMID: 22820643, 15199139, 12640683, 11280734). In the overwhelming majority of cases, cells with deregulated MDM2 or MDM4 retain wild-type p53 (PMID: 23303139). Thus, inhibition of the p53 interaction with MDM2 or MDM4 is an attractive candidate strategy for treatment of cancer via the reactivation of p53 (PMID: 25621298, 21098696, 20080970, 14704432, 25201201, 23374098, 16905541, 16540668).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-01","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4194,"hugoSymbol":"MDM4","name":"MDM4, p53 regulator","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000367182","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002393.4","geneAliases":["MRP1","HDMX","MDMX"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25621298","title":"MDM4 expression as an indicator of TP53 reactivation by combined targeting of MDM2 and MDM4 in cancer cells without TP53 mutation.","journal":"Oncoscience","pubDate":"2014","volume":"1","issue":"12","pages":"830-43","authors":"Hirose M et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Hirose M et al.
