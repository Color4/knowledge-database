ASXL2 is a member of the ASXL gene family that includes ASXL1, ASXL2 and ASXL3, which all have a C-terminal plant homology domain (PHD domain) that is predicted to recognize histone H3 tails via methylated lysines (PMID: 23147254). ASXL2 shares several conserved domains with ASXL1, a protein that regulates gene expression by interaction with the chromatin Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), and mutations in these genes are mutually exclusive in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting they may have similar functions and may contribute to transformation in the same way (PMID: 23147254, 19270745, 12888926). ASXL2 interacts with the chromatin-modifying enzyme BAP1 (PMID: 22878500), has been found to regulate nuclear receptors such as the retinoic acid receptor, LXRα and PPARγ (PMID: 25065743, 24321552, 21047783) and was identified as a protein that regulates bone density such that deletion of ASXL2 leads to deficient osteoclast formation in mice (PMID:21490954, 26051940).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":55252,"hugoSymbol":"ASXL2","name":"additional sex combs like 2, transcriptional regulator","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000435504","curatedRefSeq":"NM_018263.4","geneAliases":["ASXH2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"25065743","title":"WTIP interacts with ASXL2 and blocks ASXL2-mediated activation of retinoic acid signaling.","journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","pubDate":"2014 Aug 15","volume":"451","issue":"1","pages":"101-6","authors":"Khan FF et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.080","link":null,"reference":"Khan FF et al.
