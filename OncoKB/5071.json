The PARK2 protein functions by physical interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, including UBCH7 and UBCH7 (PMID:19946270). Through regulation of protein stability, PARK2 plays a role in several molecular processes which contribute to oncogenesis, including but not limited to cell cycle progression (PMID:24793136), mitochondrial homeostasis (PMID: 25815004, 24149988) and apoptosis (PMID: 19679562). PARK2 is frequently deleted across a variety of cancer types (PMID: 24793136, 24297497, 19946270); however, other forms of PARK2 inactivation, including somatic mutation and promoter hypermethylation/down-regulation of expression, have also been observed (PMID:24297497 ;cBioPortal,MSKCC, Nov. 2015). Recently, germline mutation in PARK2 has been associated with familial lung cancer (PMID: 25640678).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5071,"hugoSymbol":"PARK2","name":"parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000366898","curatedRefSeq":"NM_004562.2","geneAliases":["PDJ","LPRS2","AR-JP"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"19679562","title":"Parkin selectively alters the intrinsic threshold for mitochondrial cytochrome c release.","journal":"Human molecular genetics","pubDate":"2009 Nov 15","volume":"18","issue":"22","pages":"4317-28","authors":"Berger AK et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddp384","link":null,"reference":"Berger AK et al.
