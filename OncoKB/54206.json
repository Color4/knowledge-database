The protein, also known as Mig6, acts as a negative regulator of many members of the EGF receptor family and of HGF/SF-Met signaling (PMID: 11003669, 26280531, 11843178, 18046415, 15556944, 21576352, 12833145, 16247031). By binding to EGF receptors, Mig6 inhibits their catalytic activity and drives their internalization (PMID: 20421427, 17599051). The CRIB domain at the amino terminus of Mig6 is important for the binding of the protein to Cdc42, whereas the C-terminus contains an ERB-binding domain that is important for the inhibitory activity exerted on the members of the EGF receptor family (PMID: 10749885, 17599051, 12833145). Mig6 plays a pivotal role in cell signaling, development, homeostasis and stress response (PMID: 16087873, 19683494, 16782890, 22975324, 22912762, 19710174, 12384522). Studies in mice have shown that Mig6 acts as a tumor suppressor; the deletion of RALT, the murine gene that encodes Mig6, leads to hyperactivation of EGFR signaling, resulting in skin hyperplasia with spontaneous formation of tumors in various organs. In addition, Mig6 has been shown to promote tumor initiation and progression in a mouse model of mutant EGFR-driven lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 16648858, 16819504, 25735773). Downregulation of Mig6 has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, endometrial cancer cell lines and glioblastoma (PMID: 20044804, 21113414, 19439667, 20351267). Loss of Mig6 expression, which has been observed in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cell lines, negatively influences the tumor response to Herceptin, an ERBB2-directed drug. In addition, downregulation of Mig6 is associated with reduced survival in patients with breast cancer and is considered a potential prognostic biomarker (PMID: 15856022, 14871811, 22255596). Loss of heterozygosity on 1p36, the chromosome where ERRFI1 is located, has been observed in lung adenocarcinoma, late-stage lung cancer (among patients with a history of smoking) and colon cancer, and it results in shorter disease-free interval (PMID: 10862041, 25753424, 10987304, 15900585, 9287966). Loss of ERRFI1 function, owing to methylation, acetylation or nonsense mutations, is found in lung cancer, melanoma cell lines and cholangiocarcinoma, which had good response to the EGFR targeted inhibitor erlotinib (PMID: 22701735, 16819504, 24550739). Missense mutations in ERRFI1 have been found, albeit rarely, in neuroblastoma tumors and lung cancer cell lines (PMID: 17940511, 16819504).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-05","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":54206,"hugoSymbol":"ERRFI1","name":"ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000377482","curatedRefSeq":"NM_018948.3","geneAliases":["RALT","MIG-6","GENE-33","MIG6"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"15900585","title":"Genomewide loss of heterozygosity and its clinical associations in non small cell lung cancer.","journal":"International journal of cancer","pubDate":"2005 Nov 1","volume":"117","issue":"2","pages":"241-7","authors":"Tseng RC et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Tseng RC et al.
