[{"evidenceId":16607,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The ERBB3 (HER3) gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Family (EGFR) of proteins (PMID: 19536107, 11252954, 19208461). ERBB3 is unique in that it has limited kinase activity, approximately 1000 fold less than its family member, EGFR (PMID: 8389462, 8058764, 20351256). Thereby, ERBB3 cannot form homodimers (PMID: 15225657), and thus is not transforming on its own nor by constant stimulation by its ligands neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) and NRG-2 (PMID: 19208461) in the absence of a dimer partner (PMID: 8632008). Yet, ERBB3 has sufficient kinase activity to bind its preferred heterodimer partner, ERBB2 (PMID: 20351256, 20007378, 10220407, 9130710) and catalyze autophosphorylation of its C-terminal intracellular tail, which recruits adapter proteins that potently initiate mitogenic cascades, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (PMID: 7515147, 8026468, 8264617), RAS/MAPK, SRC and STAT pathways (PMID: 12853564, 22785351). Cell line, xenograft and transgenic mouse data demonstrate that ERBB2-amplified cells exquisitely rely on ERBB3 to drive proliferation and survival (PMID: 12853564, 24651011, 19536107). Moreover, ERBB3 feedback upregulation, localization changes and ligand overexpression contribute to resistance to ERBB or PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors (PMID: 24520092, 24651011, 19536107). Increased ERBB3 levels correlate with tumor progression and poor prognosis in some cancers (PMID: 20179223, 20816829). ERBB3 is mutated in approximately 10% of gastric, bladder, uterine and colorectal cancers, and in other cancers, including breast cancer, at frequencies <5% (PMID: 23680147). A few mutants have been functionally characterized as oncogenic in the presence of ERBB2 (PMID: 23680147), including the most common mutant allele, V104M. There are no FDA approved ERBB3 inhibitors, but clinical trials are underway for a variety of ERBB3 targeting compounds.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2065,"hugoSymbol":"ERBB3","name":"erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000267101","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001982.3","geneAliases":["ErbB-3","p180-ErbB3","p45-sErbB3","LCCS2","c-erbB-3","c-erbB3","p85-sErbB3","MDA-BF-1","erbB3-S","HER3"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"8026468","title":"Identification of c-erbB-3 binding sites for phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and SHC using an EGF receptor/c-erbB-3 chimera.","journal":"The EMBO journal","pubDate":"1994 Jun 15","volume":"13","issue":"12","pages":"2831-41","authors":"Prigent SA et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Prigent SA et al.
