[{"evidenceId":17813,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"KMT5A encodes the lysine methyltransferase SETD8, which specifically methylates lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me1), a histone mark implicated in DNA replication and DNA repair. SETD8 is typically bound to euchromatin regions and the placement of the H4K20me1 mark is thought to have a role in transcriptional repression (PMID: 12086618, 16517599). SETD8 is also required for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis and subsequent cellular proliferation (PMID: 15200950). Additionally, SETD8 has other methylation targets independent of histones including PCNA, Numb and p53, where methylation has roles in promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, regulating cell proliferation, and suppression of p53-dependent transcriptional programs (PMID: 26717907, 23706821, 22556262, 17707234). SETD8 mutations are rare in human cancers.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-04","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":387893,"hugoSymbol":"KMT5A","name":"lysine methyltransferase 5A","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000330479","curatedRefSeq":"NM_020382.3","geneAliases":["SET8","PR-Set7","SETD8","SET07"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"23706821","title":"Dynamic methylation of Numb by Set8 regulates its binding to p53 and apoptosis.","journal":"Molecular cell","pubDate":"2013 May 23","volume":"50","issue":"4","pages":"565-76","authors":"Dhami GK et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2013.04.028","link":null,"reference":"Dhami GK et al.
