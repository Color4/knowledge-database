[{"evidenceId":14977,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"PTEN encodes a tumor suppressor that is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer (PMID: 9072974, 9090379, 22473468). PTEN has several physiological functions, most notably operating as a phosphatase that converts phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-triphosphate (PIP2) at the cell membrane (PMID: 18767981). Impairment of PTEN function through multiple mechanisms, including through non-synonymous mutations, results in PIP3 accumulation and constitutive activation of catabolic downstream AKT/mTOR signaling. PTEN inactivation therefore promotes cell growth, proliferation and survival (PMID: 12040186). Additionally, nuclear PTEN is thought to regulate RAD51 expression, and in this way is also associated with homologous recombination and repair of DNA strand breaks (PMID: 17218262, 23888040). Thus, loss of PTEN may also lead to greater genomic instability and provide a setting for the accumulation of other deleterious mutations. PTEN is frequently mutated in many types of human cancers (PMID: 15254063). Germline loss-of-function PTEN mutations occur in approximately 80% of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome Cowden disease, which is associated with high-penetrance breast and thyroid cancer (PMID: 9467011, 24136893, 21430697).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-28","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":5728,"hugoSymbol":"PTEN","name":"phosphatase and tensin homolog","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000371953","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000314.4","geneAliases":["DEC","MHAM","10q23del","BZS","PTEN1","GLM2","CWS1","MMAC1"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"24136893","title":"Cowden syndrome and the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome: systematic review and revised diagnostic criteria.","journal":"Journal of the National Cancer Institute","pubDate":"2013 Nov 6","volume":"105","issue":"21","pages":"1607-16","authors":"Pilarski R et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1093/jnci/djt277","link":null,"reference":"Pilarski R et al.
