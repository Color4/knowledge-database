It is phosphorylated by Janus kinase (JAK) kinases, resulting in dimerization and nuclear translocation (PMID:25527793). STAT5B regulates the development and differentiation of tissues and cell types including the mammary gland, hepatocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, and B-cells and T-cells (PMID:15711548, 23773921, 8961260, 8906870, 18347089, 16418296). In cancer, STAT5B signaling is important for tumor progression, resistance, and transformation in various cancers including prostate cancer, breast cancer, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and leukemias (PMID:22234689, 23660011, 18508994). Activating STAT5B mutations are found in large granular lymphocytic leukemia and subtypes of lymphomas (PMID:23596048, 25586472, 24972766). STAT5B is also found in rare translocations with RARA in cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (PMID:22749039).
