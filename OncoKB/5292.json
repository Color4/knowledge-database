PIM1 cooperates with the MYC oncogene and can lead to genomic instability (PMID:21860423, 14678956). It targets many important proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival including MYC, nitric oxide synthase and Bad (PMID:18438430, 15280015, 26598507). Its expression is upregulated in multiple tumor types including leukemias, glioblastoma, pancreatic and prostate cancers (PIMD:15498859, 25155357,18708761). PIM1 expression is associated with prostate and gastric cancer prognosis (PMID:11518967, 21993851). PIM1 mutations are found in lymphomas (PMID:11460166, 24970810, 26773040).
