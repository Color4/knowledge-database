[{"evidenceId":17591,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The CDK12 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 12) gene encodes a proposed tumor suppressor involved in DNA damage repair. This gene was first identified in a cDNA screen for cell cycle regulators. CDK12 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP) in vitro (PMID: 11683387). CDK12 interacts with cyclin L1 and cyclin L2, and the CDK12/cyclin L complex is involved in alternative RNA splicing (PMID: 16537916). However, cyclin K was later shown to be the main partner for CDK12 and the CDK12/cyclin K complex was found to maintain genomic stability via regulation of the expression of DNA damage response genes, such as BRCA1, ATR, FANCI and FANCD2. Loss of the CDK12/cyclin K complex renders HEK293 cells sensitive to various DNA damaging agents, including camptothecin, etoposide and mitomycin C (PMID: 22012619). CDK12 is one of the most frequently somatically mutated genes in ovarian cancer (PMID: 21720365), which is consistent with its role in the maintenance of genomic stability. Of note, flavopiridol is an agent that has been demonstrated to show potent CDK12 inhibition in in vitro studies (PMID: 25712099, 24662513), but has never been linked to activity in a specific cancer type.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-26","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":51755,"hugoSymbol":"CDK12","name":"cyclin dependent kinase 12","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000447079","curatedRefSeq":"NM_016507.2","geneAliases":["CRK7","CRKR","CRKRS"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"22012619","title":"The Cyclin K/Cdk12 complex maintains genomic stability via regulation of expression of DNA damage response genes.","journal":"Genes &amp; development","pubDate":"2011 Oct 15","volume":"25","issue":"20","pages":"2158-72","authors":"Blazek D et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1101/gad.16962311","link":null,"reference":"Blazek D et al.
