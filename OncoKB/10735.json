[{"evidenceId":18419,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"STAG2 encodes the cohesin subunit SA-2, a component of the cohesin complex that is required for cohesion of the sister chromatids at the centromere after DNA replication in both meiosis and mitosis (PMID: 12034751, 19822671, 21444719). Microduplication of the Xq25 chromosome, containing the locus of STAG2, is seen in some types of cohesinopathy that are characterized by abnormal behavior, intellectual disability, distinctive facial appearance and disorders in speech (PMID: 23637084, 25677961, 25450604, 26443594). Inactivating mutations in STAG2 lead to aneuploidy and chromosomal instability in cancer (PMID: 21852505). Nonsense mutations and deletions of STAG2 are found together in melanoma, Ewing sarcoma, glioblastoma, head and neck carcinoma, bladder carcinoma and myeloid neoplasms, whereas deletions alone are observed in gastric, colorectal and prostate cancers (PMID: 24856830, 21852505, 26122845, 25010205, 24270882, 24121792, 25186949, 22668012, 25223734, 239555599, 25501392, 24121789, 20687102, 24056718, 24335498, 24121791, 25867412). Somatic mutations of STAG2 are observed in myeloid malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, and are associated with worse overall survival and better response to some therapeutic treatments (PMID: 25501392, 25006131, 24335498). STAG2 mutations are prevalent in leukemia patients with IDH2 mutations and are found in more than 95% of patients with secondary leukemia (PMID: 25836588, 25550361). Nonsynonymous mutations are found in glioblastoma, uterine carcinoma and breast carcinoma (PMID: 26352260). Of importance, glioblastomas harboring STAG2 mutations are more sensitive to PARP inhibition (PMID: 24356817).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-03-16","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":10735,"hugoSymbol":"STAG2","name":"stromal antigen 2","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000218089","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001042749.1","geneAliases":["SCC3B","bA517O1.1","SA-2","SA2"],"tsg":true},"articles":[{"pmid":"19822671","title":"Differential regulation of telomere and centromere cohesion by the Scc3 homologues SA1 and SA2, respectively, in human cells.","journal":"The Journal of cell biology","pubDate":"2009 Oct 19","volume":"187","issue":"2","pages":"165-73","authors":"Canudas S et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1083/jcb.200903096","link":null,"reference":"Canudas S et al.
