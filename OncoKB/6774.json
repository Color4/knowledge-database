[{"evidenceId":18119,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) encodes a transcription factor that is regulated by cytokines and growth factors including Interferons (IFNs), Epidermal growth factor (EGF), Interleukin 5 and 6 (IL5, IL6), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) (PMID: 26464811). STAT3 is phosphorylated by Janus kinase (JAK) kinases, resulting in dimerization and nuclear translocation (PMID: 25527793). STAT3 is involved in regulating development of the skin, central nervous system, and mammary tissue (PMID:11994402, 10342556). Activated STAT3 is found in various cancer types, most notably in breast cancer, and implicated in pathways important for survival, immune dysregulation, tumor microenvironment modulation and cellular invasion (PMID: 25342631, 11420660, 21310826, 16463269). Activation of STAT3 may also be a means of tumor drug resistance (PMID: 25065853). STAT3 mutations are found in hyper-IgE syndrome characterized by elevated IgE levels, connective tissue abnormalities, and immunodeficiency (PMID: 17881745). Germline mutations in STAT3 are also associated with autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation (PMID: 25359994). In cancer, activating STAT3 mutations are found in large granular lymphocytic leukemia and more rarely in myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and lymphomas (PMID: 22591296, 23926297, 25586472). Mutations have also been found in inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas, and copy number alterations have been identified in breast cancer samples (PMID: 21690253, 25470049).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-03","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6774,"hugoSymbol":"STAT3","name":"signal transducer and activator of transcription 3","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000264657","curatedRefSeq":"NM_139276.2","geneAliases":["ADMIO","APRF","HIES"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25586472","title":"Activating mutations of STAT5B and STAT3 in lymphomas derived from γδ-T or NK cells.","journal":"Nature communications","pubDate":"2015 Jan 14","volume":"6","issue":"","pages":"6025","authors":"Küçük C et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ncomms7025","link":null,"reference":"Küçük C et al.
