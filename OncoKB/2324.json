Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C signaling through FLT4 (VEGFR3) has been shown to mediate cell proliferation, survival and resistance to chemotherapy in leukemia (PMID: 11877295), and to promote invasion and metastasis of human lung adenocarcinoma cells (PMID: 16530705). Mutations in FLT4 cause hereditary Nonne-Milroy disease, an autosomal dominant form of primary lymphedema type IA (PMID: 11292664). In addition to its expression on lymphatic endothelial cells, FLT4 expression has been observed in lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 12875690), colorectal adenocarcinoma (PMID: 12168824), head and neck carcinomas (PMID: 12784238), prostate carcinoma (PMID: 15701844), leukemia (PMID: 11877295), and Kaposi's sarcoma (PMID: 10068212). FLT4 expression levels were also shown to correlate with different stages of cervical carcinogenesis (PMID: 14648657). Few cancer-associated mutations in FLT4 have been reported.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-04-07","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":2324,"hugoSymbol":"FLT4","name":"fms related tyrosine kinase 4","oncogene":true,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000261937","curatedRefSeq":"NM_182925.4","geneAliases":["VEGFR3","FLT41","VEGFR-3","PCL","FLT-4","LMPH1A"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"11877295","title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C signaling through FLT-4 (VEGFR-3) mediates leukemic cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy.","journal":"Blood","pubDate":"2002 Mar 15","volume":"99","issue":"6","pages":"2179-84","authors":"Dias S et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Dias S et al.
