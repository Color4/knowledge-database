The SMARCD1 protein is a member of the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable) complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that alters the location or conformation of nucleosomes by using the energy of ATP hydrolysis and thus can regulate transcription of certain genes. To this end, SMARCD1 interacts with a wide repertoire of transcription factors including Oct3/4, Sox2, Sox10, c-Fos/c-Jun, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, vitamin D receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, retinoid-related orphan receptor α, androgen receptor and recruits them to the SWI/SNF complex (PMID: 11053448, 12917342, 14698202, 18680712, 19762545, 20508149, 21725993, 22334693). SMARCD1 is required for Tbx1-driven expression of Wnt5a, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that promotes cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer (PMID: 22438823, 17079465). Moreover, SMARCD1 interacts directly and indirectly with key regulators of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, which in some cases maintains pluripotency (PMID:19279220) and in other cases restricts it (PMID: 25818293). A series of recent studies showed that SMARCD1 is a direct target of tumor-suppressive miRNA (micro RNAs), namely miR-99 in prostate cancer (PMID: 21212412), miR-490-3p in gastric and ovarian cancer (PMID: 25503559, 25819031) and miR-100 in breast cancer stem-like cells (PMID: 25217527). On the other hand, tumor-suppressive properties of SMARCD1 have been reported; interaction between SMARCD1 and p53 is required for p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (PMID: 18303029) and SMARCD1 is frequently inactivated by truncating mutations in breast cancer (PMID: 22722201). It becomes therefore obvious that the function of SMARCD1 in carcinogenesis is complex and context-dependent.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":6602,"hugoSymbol":"SMARCD1","name":"SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily d, member 1","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000394963","curatedRefSeq":"NM_003076.4","geneAliases":["BAF60A","Rsc6p","CRACD1"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"22334693","title":"Determination of protein interactome of transcription factor Sox2 in embryonic stem cells engineered for inducible expression of four reprogramming factors.","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pubDate":"2012 Mar 30","volume":"287","issue":"14","pages":"11384-97","authors":"Gao Z et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.320143","link":null,"reference":"Gao Z et al.
