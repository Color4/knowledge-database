[{"evidenceId":19302,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"The MST1R (Macrophage Stimulating 1 Receptor) gene encodes a cell surface receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) with tyrosine kinase activity. The MST1R protein is one of two members of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase family, along with parent receptor MET. Its activation triggers downstream signaling cascades, including RAS, PI3-kinase (PI3-K), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP-K) to induce cell scattering, migration, survival and invasion (PMID: 12807733,18836480, 25997828). MSTR1 is expressed in various cell types including macrophages, epithelial and hematopoietic cells MST1R is overexpressed in pancreatic and epithelial cancers of the breast, colon, lung, and prostate (PMID: 22834780, 17616662, 17311308, 26477314, 15289319), and is involved in tumor progression and metastasis (PMID: 15289319, 10910951, 19956854). MST1 is rarely mutated, but alternative splicing events are common as the gene transcript is increasingly overexpressed. Approximately eight different MST1R isoforms have been described in various epithelial cancer types (PMID: 23792360). In breast cancer, short-form MST1R overexpression specifically activates the PI3K signaling pathway, resulting in increased tumor growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and increased metastasis (PMID: 22207901). In prostate cancer cells, MST1R has been shown to regulate angiogenic chemokine production (PMID: 19838218). Additionally, one study using gastroesophageal carcinoma (GEC) samples reported increased MST1R gene copy number in 35.5% (16/45) of cases and a novel somatic MST1R juxtamembrane mutation (R1018G) in 11% of samples, making MST1R an important prognostic marker in this GEC cohort (PMID: 21543897)","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-17","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":4486,"hugoSymbol":"MST1R","name":"macrophage stimulating 1 receptor","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000296474","curatedRefSeq":"NM_002447.2","geneAliases":["RON","PTK8","CDw136","CD136"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"12807733","title":"Oncogenic and invasive potentials of human macrophage-stimulating protein receptor, the RON receptor tyrosine kinase.","journal":"Carcinogenesis","pubDate":"2003 Aug","volume":"24","issue":"8","pages":"1291-300","authors":"Wang MH et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Wang MH et al.
