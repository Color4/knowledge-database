[{"evidenceId":18310,"evidenceType":"GENE_BACKGROUND","shortDesc":null,"desc":"TMEM127 (transmembrane protein 127) encodes a tumor suppressor protein with three predicted transmembrane domains. In vitro experiments confirm the localization of TMEM127 at the plasma membrane and indicate a tumor-suppressor role through reduction of mTORC1 activity, demonstrated by phosphorylation of the mTOR effector, S6K, upon TMEM127 depletion (PMID: 20923864, 20154675, 21156949). The latter has also been shown in a tissue sample from a patient with pheochromocytoma (PMID: 20923864). Cell line studies suggest that the failure of mutated TMEM127 to inhibit mTORC1 is due to loss of association with the mTOR inhibitor RAB5 (PMID: ). Truncating germline variants in TMEM127, often in concert with loss of heterozygosity at its genomic locus, confer increased risk for pheochromocytoma and paraganglial tumors (PMID: 20923864, 20154675, 21156949, 22541004, 21613359). TMEM127 mutations have also been observed in renal cancer.","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-01-18","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":55654,"hugoSymbol":"TMEM127","name":"transmembrane protein 127","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000258439","curatedRefSeq":"NM_001193304.2","geneAliases":[],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"20154675","title":"Germline mutations in TMEM127 confer susceptibility to pheochromocytoma.","journal":"Nature genetics","pubDate":"2010 Mar","volume":"42","issue":"3","pages":"229-33","authors":"Qin Y et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1038/ng.533","link":null,"reference":"Qin Y et al.
