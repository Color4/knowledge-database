IL-10 expression is tightly regulated by specific transcription factors based on immune cell type, which prevents excessive immune responses and autoimmune disease (PMID: 20154735). In macrophages and dendritic cells, IL-10 is involved in the regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and can block NF-ÎºB activity (PMID: 14678266). IL-10 deficient mice develop inflammatory diseases with excessive immune responses after pathogen challenge (PMID: 24566625). Conversely, high IL-10 expression in mice has also been shown to promote an anti-tumor immune response (PMID: 18613832). IL-10 mutations have been identified in early-onset immune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (PMID: 25373860). Higher IL-10 levels are associated with more aggressive disease and increased macrophage recruitment following chemotherapy in pre-clinical models of breast cancer (PMID: 25559954) and blockade of IL-10 receptors can improve chemotherapy responses in mice (PMID: 25446896).","id":null,"lastEdit":"2017-10-09","status":null,"gene":{"entrezGeneId":3586,"hugoSymbol":"IL10","name":"interleukin 10","oncogene":false,"curatedIsoform":"ENST00000423557","curatedRefSeq":"NM_000572.2","geneAliases":["CSIF","TGIF","GVHDS","IL10A","IL-10"],"tsg":false},"articles":[{"pmid":"25373860","title":"Clinical features of interleukin 10 receptor gene mutations in children with very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease.","journal":"Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition","pubDate":"2015 Mar","volume":"60","issue":"3","pages":"332-8","authors":"Beser OF et al","elocationId":"doi: 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000621","link":null,"reference":"Beser OF et al.
