The binding of ligands to EGFR induces a conformational change and receptor homo- or heterodimer formation, which leads to activation of EGFR kinase activity. The activated EGFR phosphorylates its substrates, resulting in activation of downstream signaling pathways including the MAPK pathway and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These activated oncogenic pathways cause changes in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation [PMID: 18045542]. </li><li>Mutations and amplification of the EGFR gene result in hyperactivation of this receptor and activation of downstream signaling pathways [PMID: 10880430]. </li><li>  In glioma, mutations of EGFR usually cluster in the extracellular (EC) domain and include in-frame deletions, such as EGFRvIII (amino acids 6-273 are deleted). However, some mutations in tyrosine kinase domain were also reported [PMID: 22588883, PMID: 12438278, PMID: 17177598]. </li></ul></p><p><b>Frequent variants:</b><ul><li>EGFR amplification is the most common alteration of EGFR in gliomas. The amplification is much more frequent in primary glioblastomas than in secondary glioblastomas. All EGFR amplification in primary glioblastomas leads to EGFR overexpression [PMID: 17456751]. EGFR amplification is associated with small cell phenotype in glioblastoma [PMID: 11706939]. EGFR amplification was not detected in glioblastomas from patients under 35 years of age [PMID: 15466178]. </li><li>EGFR amplification is often associated with EGFR variant 3 (EGFRvIII) mutation, an in-frame deletion (amino acids 6-273 are deleted), which is the most frequent mutations in EGFR amplicons. This is a constitutive activating form that activates PI3K signaling pathway and downregulates p27 [PMID: 12438278]. EGFRvIII mutation is sensitive to BAY846, an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 [PMID: 22203214]. </li><li>EGFR-SEPT14 fusion is the most common functional gene fusion in glioblastoma. This fusion protein activates STAT3 signaling and sensitive to EGFR inhibition [PMID: 23917401]. </li><li>EGFR A289 and G598 mutations induce anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity in vitro [PMID: 17177598]. A289 mutation is sensitive to BAY846, an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 [PMID: 22203214]. </li><li>EGFR R108K mutation leads to enhanced ligand-binding affinity and anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity in vitro [PMID: 17177598]</li></ul></p><p><b>Prevalence: </b><ul><il>EGFR amplification is found in over 40% of primary glioblastomas and <10% of secondary glioblastomas, and 5-10% of anaplastic astrocytomas [PMID: 24120142, PMID: 20824044].</li><li>EGFR amplification is only found in less than 5% of pediatric GBMs [PMID: 20824044]  </li><li>EGFR amplification is found in about 70% of small cell GBMs, 0% of gliosarcomas and 6% of giant cell GBMs [PMID: 20824044].</li><li>EGFRvIII mutation is found in 20-30% of unselected primary glioblastomas and 50-60% of the EGFR amplified glioblastomas [PMID: 19324552].

However, EGFR overexpression is associated with worse prognosis in patients younger than median age (aged 55 years) but better prognosis in patients older than median age. In the younger group, the correlation between EGFR overexpression and shorter survival was only identified in p53-negative but not p53-positive patients, and only in p53 wild-type patients [PMID: 11221842].</li><li>In a study of 63 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and 111 GBM patients, EGFR amplification is associated with longer survival in GBM patients over 60 years of age [PMID: 11504770].</li><li>In a study of 140 GBM patients, EGFR amplification is associated with shorter survival in patients under 46 years and longer survival in patients over 46 years [PMID: 14734474].  </li><li>In a retrospective clinical study of 87 GBM patients, EGFR amplification is associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (1.199 vs 1.684 years, P = 0.007). Especially in patients under 60 years, this correlation is more significant (1.133 vs 2.324 years, P = 0.0002). In all GBM patients, EGFRvIII overexpression has no effect on survival.
