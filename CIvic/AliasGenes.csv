"332",58,"VHL",7428,"Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by heterozygous germline mutation in VHL gene on chromosome 3p. Patients are predisposed to developing hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors; endolymphatic sac tumors; and epididymal and broad ligament cysts. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache, vomiting, gait disturbances, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL disease and can cause vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems, unless bilateral, in which case they may result in infertility.The VHL gene product encodes pVHL, which binds to elongin C, elongin B, cullin-2 and Rbx1. This complex catalyzes the polyubiquitinylation of specific proteins and targets them for degradation by proteosomes. For example, under normoxic conditions, hydroxylated hypoxia-inducble factor alpha subunits (HIFÃƒ_Ã‚Â±) binds pVHL targets HIFÃƒ_Ã‚Â± for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1Ãƒ_Ã‚Â± is not hydroxylated, pVHL does not bind, and HIF1Ãƒ_Ã‚Â± subunits accumulate. HIF1Ãƒ_Ã‚Â± forms heterodimers with HIF1Ãƒ__ and activates transcription of a variety of hypoxia-inducible genes (i.e., VEGF, EPO, TGFÃƒ_Ã‚Â±, PDGFÃƒ__). Likewise, when pVHL is absent or mutated, HIF1Ãƒ_Ã‚Â± subunits accumulate, resulting in cell proliferation and the neovascularization of tumors characteristic of VHL disease. Pathogenic variants in VHL either prevent its expression (i.e., deletions, frameshifts, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations) or lead to the expression of an abnormal protein (i.e., missense mutations). Missense mutations that destabilize packing of the alpha-helical domains, decrease the stability of the alpha-beta domain interface, interfere with binding of elongin C and HIF1Ãƒ_Ã‚Â±, or disrupt hydrophobic core residues result in loss of HIF regulation and are more likely to result in VHL type 1 (no predisposition to pheochromocytoma).  Missense mutations that result in pVHL that is normal with respect to HIF regulation are more likely to be associated with VHL with clinical pheochromocytoma. Acquired somatic pathogenic variants in VHL may give rise to sporadic VHL-type tumors (i.e., clear cell RCC and hemangioblastoma) without other associated tumors characteristic of the hereditary disease. It should be noted that >90% of the most common form of kidney cancer (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) are associated with bi-allelic somatic mutation in the VHL gene, and is the rationale for the anti-angiogenic therapy for RCC patients.","RCA1"

"450",75,"PAX8",7849,"PAX8 is one of nine transcription factors within the PAX gene family. It has been observed to be expressed during embryonic development however expression attenuates after development in all but a few tissues. Research has indicated that over-expression of PAX proteins in general are not an initiating event in tumorgenesis however they may facilitate malignant development. PAX8 is expressed in 80-96% of all High-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) and is commonly used as a marker for the disease. In addition PAX8 has become a useful biomarker for differentiating between mullerian mucinous and non-mullerian tumors. PAX8 has also been associated with neoplasms in the kidney and thyroid.","PAX8"

FGFR1 signalling downstream functions mainly via PI3K and MAPK pathways (Turner et. al.). Several ways of involvement of FGFR1 in cancer have been proposed: auto- and paracrine activation, amplification and overexpression (Marshall et. al,  Weiss et. al.,  Cheng et. al.).Especially amplification of FGFR1 in lung cancer is an emerging treatment target with clinical studies currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224). However, FGFR1 amplification does not always correlate with protein expression and predictive biomarkers still remain to be defined in clinic (von MÃƒÆ’_ssenhausen et. al.).Mutation of FGFR1 seems to be less common, but has been described in glioblastoma, pilocytic astrocytomas and Ewing's sarcoma (Rand et. al., Jones et. al., Agelopoulos et. al.).","HRTFDS"
